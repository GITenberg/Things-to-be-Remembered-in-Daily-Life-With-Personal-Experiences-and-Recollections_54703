<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Time</span> and Human Life are the staple subjects of the following
pages. These are great matters for so small a
book, and may remind you of the philosophical scheme of
compressing the world into a nutshell. Now, although we
have as yet no means of determining exactly what relation
this latter idea has to truth,—it is certain that the rapid
multiplication of books incessantly presses upon us, that
“condensation is the result of time and experience, which
reject what is no longer essential.” Such is the treatment
adopted in the present volume, in which, by <i>focusing</i> great
truths from the Living and the Dead, is sought to be exemplified
the moral couplet:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Honour and shame from no condition rise;</div>
      <div class='line'>Act well your part—there all the honour lies.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>As a companion volume to <i>Things not Generally Known</i>,
it is hoped that <i>Things to be Remembered</i> may be as popularly
received as its predecessor. To render the present
work more directly of practical application, the sketches
of character which it contains have been drawn in great
measure from our own time, so as to give the book a current
interest. Meanwhile, historic gossip has not been
eschewed; but its piquancy has been sparingly used.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>The present is, in many respects, a more reflective
volume than its predecessor: for it is scarcely possible to
illustrate the Ages of Man without</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This is one of the byways of the book: its highway
lies through the crowded city, and upon “the full tide of
human affairs;” and the Experiences here set down are, in
common parlance, <i>original</i>, and have been chiefly garnered
throughout a long life, in which truthful observation has
been the cardinal aim.</p>

<p class='c009'>With these few words of introduction, I commend to
your indulgence this volume of <i>Things to be Remembered
in Daily Life</i>, in the hope that its contents may be considered
worthy of the reminiscence.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>Time.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>The</span> conventional personification of Time, with which every
one is familiar, is the figure of Saturn, god of Time, represented
as an old man, holding a scythe in his hand, and
a serpent with its tail in its mouth, emblematical of the
revolutions of the year: sometimes he carries an hour-glass,
occasionally winged; to him is attributed the invention of
the scythe. He is bald, except a lock on the forehead;
hence Swift says: “Time is painted with a lock before, and
bald behind, signifying thereby that we must take him (as
we say) by the forelock; for when it is once passed, there
is no recalling it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The scythe occurs in Shirley’s lines, written early in the
seventeenth century:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The glories of our blood and state</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Are shadows, not substantial things;</div>
      <div class='line'>There is no armour against fate;</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Death lays his icy hand on kings.</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Sceptre and crown</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Must tumble down,</div>
      <div class='line'>And in the dust be equal made</div>
      <div class='line'>With the poor crooked scythe and spade.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Shakspeare prefers the scythe:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And delves the parallels in beauty’s brow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Feeds on the rarities of nature’s truth,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>The stealthiness of his flight is also told by Shakspeare:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Let’s take the instant by the forward top;</div>
      <div class='line'>For we are old, and our quick’st decrees</div>
      <div class='line'>The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time</div>
      <div class='line'>Steals ere we can effect them.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Mayne thus quaintly describes his flight:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Time is the feather’d thing,</div>
      <div class='line'>And whilst I praise</div>
      <div class='line'>The sparklings of thy locks, and call them rays,</div>
      <div class='line'>Takes wing—</div>
      <div class='line'>Leaving behind him, as he flies,</div>
      <div class='line'>An unperceived dimness in thine eyes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Gascoigne also thus paints the flight:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The heavens on high perpetually do move;</div>
      <div class='line in4'>By minutes’ meal the hour doth steal away,</div>
      <div class='line'>By hours the days, by days the months remove,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And then by months the years as fast decay;</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Yea, Virgil’s verse and Tully’s truth do say,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Time flieth, and never clasps her wings;</div>
      <div class='line'>But rides on clouds, and forward still she flings.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Shakspeare pictures him as the fell destroyer:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

<p class='c019'>The present section partakes much of the aphoristic
character, which has its recommendatory advantages.—Bacon
says: “Aphorisms representing a knowledge broken
do invite men to inquire further; whereas methods, carrying
the show of a total, do secure men as if they were at
farthest.” Again: “Nor do apophthegms only serve for
ornament and delight, but also for action and civil use, as
being the edge-tools of speech, which cut and penetrate the
knots of business and affairs.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Coleridge is of opinion that, exclusively of the Abstract
Sciences, the largest and worthiest portion of our knowledge
consists of Aphorisms; and the greatest and best of men is
but an Aphorism.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Truths, of all others the most awful and interesting,
are too often considered as so true, that they lose all the
power of truth, and lie bedridden in the dormitory of the
soul, side by side with the most despised and exploded
errors.</p>

<p class='c019'>“There is one way of giving freshness and importance to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>the most commonplace maxims,—that of reflecting on them
in direct reference to our own state and conduct, to our own
past and future being.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Mature and sedate wisdom has been fond of summing
up the results of its experience in weighty sentences. Solomon
did so; the wise men of India and Greece did so; Bacon
did so; Goethe in his old age took delight in doing so.</p>
<p class='c021'>Lucretius has his philosophical view of Time, which
Creech has thus Englished:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Time of itself is nothing, but from Thought</div>
      <div class='line'>Receives its rise, by lab’ring fancy wrought</div>
      <div class='line'>From things consider’d, while we think on some</div>
      <div class='line'>As present, some as past, or yet to come.</div>
      <div class='line'>No thought can think on Time,</div>
      <div class='line'>But thinks on things in motion or at rest.</div>
    </div>

<p class='c021'>Ovid has some illustrations, which Dryden has thus

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>

      <div class='line'>No steadfast motion, but or ebbs or flows.</div>
      <div class='line'>Ever in motion, she destroys her old,</div>
      <div class='line'>And casts new figures in another mould.</div>
      <div class='line'>Even times are in perpetual flux, and run,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like rivers from their fountains rolling on.</div>
      <div class='line'>For Time, no more than streams, is at a stay,—</div>
      <div class='line'>The flying hour is ever on her way;</div>
      <div class='line'>And as the fountain still supplies her store,</div>
      <div class='line'>The wave behind impels the wave before;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus in successive course the minutes run,</div>
      <div class='line'>And urge their predecessor minutes on,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still moving, ever anew; for former things</div>
      <div class='line'>Are set aside, like abdicated kings;</div>

      <div class='line'>Time, like a stream that hastens from the shore,</div>
      <div class='line'>Flies to an ocean where ’tis known no more:</div>
      <div class='line'>All must be swallow’d in this endless deep,</div>
      <div class='line'>And motion rest in everlasting sleep.</div>
      <div class='line'>*          *          *          *</div>
      <div class='line'>Time glides along with undiscover’d haste,</div>
      <div class='line'>The future but a length behind the past,</div>
      <div class='line'>So swift are years.</div>
      <div class='line'>*          *          *          *</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy teeth, devouring Time! thine, envious Age!</div>
      <div class='line'>On things below still exercise your rage;</div>

      <div class='line'>Alike irrevocable both when past,</div>

      <div class='line'>Though each resembles each in every part,</div>

      <div class='line'>But time, that should enrich the nobler mind,</div>

<p class='c021'>Edward Moore, in one of his pleasing Songs, thus points
to these charming influences:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Time still, as he flies, adds increase to her truth,</div>

      <div class='line'>For others’ good, and melt at others’ woe.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>How well has Shakspeare expressed this work of the
great reconciler:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Time’s glory is to calm contending kings,</div>

      <div class='line in4'>To wake the morn, and sentinel the night,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>To wrong the wronger, till he render right.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Elsewhere Shakspeare paints him as the universal balm:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Cease to lament for that thou can’st not help,</div>
      <div class='line'>And study help for that which thou lament’st.</div>
      <div class='line'>Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>It is notorious to philosophers, that joy and grief can hasten
and delay time. Locke is of opinion that a man in great
misery may so far lose his measure, as to think a minute
an hour; or in joy make an hour a minute. Shakspeare’s
“divers paces” of Time is too familiar for quotation here.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>They who so stanchly oppose innovations, should remember
Bacon’s words: “Every medicine is an innovation,

evils; for time is the greatest innovator; and if time of
course alter things to the worse, and wisdom and counsel
shall not alter them to the better, what shall be the end?”</p>

<p class='c021'>How much time has to do with our successes is thus
solemnly told by the Preacher: “The race is not to the
swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the
wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour
to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them
all.”—<i>Ecclesiastes</i> ix. 11.</p>

<p class='c021'>How truthfully has Dr. Johnson said: “So little do we
accustom ourselves to consider the effects of time, that
things necessary and certain often surprise us like unexpected
contingencies. We leave the beauty in her bloom,
and, after an absence of twenty years, wonder, at our return,
to find her faded. We meet those whom we left children,
and can scarcely persuade ourselves to treat them as men.
The traveller visits in age those countries through which he
rambled in his youth, and hopes for merriment in the old
place. The man of business, wearied with unsatisfactory
prosperity, retires to the town of his nativity, and expects to
play away the last years with the companions of his childhood,
and recover youth in the fields where he once was
young.”</p>

<p class='c021'>“Time is almost a human word, and change entirely a
human idea: in the system of nature we should rather say
progress than change. The sun appears to sink in the
ocean in darkness, but rises in another hemisphere; the
ruins of a city fall, but they are often used to form more
magnificent structures, as at Rome; but even when they
are destroyed, so as to produce only dust, nature asserts her
empire over them, and the vegetable world rises in constant
youth, and in a period of annual successions, by the labours
of man, providing food, vitality, and beauty upon the wreck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>of monuments which were once raised for purposes of glory,
but which are now applied to objects of utility.”</p>

<p class='c021'>As this beautiful passage was written by Sir Humphry
Davy nearly three-and-thirty years since, the above use of
the word <i>progress</i> had nothing to do with the semi-political
sense in which it is now commonly employed. Nevertheless,
there occur in the writings of our great chemical
philosopher occasional views of the advancement of the
world in knowledge, and its real authors, with which the
progressists of the present day fraternise.</p>

<p class='c021'>At the above distance, Davy wrote in the following vein:
“In the common history of the world, as compiled by authors
in general, almost all the great changes of nations are
confounded with changes in their dynasties; and events
are usually referred either to sovereigns, chiefs, heroes, or
their armies, which do, in fact, originate entirely from different
causes, either of an intellectual or moral nature.
Governments depend far more than is generally supposed
upon the opinion of the people and the spirit of the age and
nation. It sometimes happens that a gigantic mind possesses
supreme power, and rises superior to the age in which
he is born: such was Alfred in England, and Peter in Russia.
Such instances are, however, very rare; and in general it is
neither amongst sovereigns nor the higher classes of society
that the great improvers and benefactors of mankind are to
be found.”—<i>Consolations in Travel</i>, pp. 34, 35.</p>

<p class='c021'>Brilliant as was Davy’s own career, it had its life-struggles:
his last days were embittered with sufferings, mental
as well as physical; and in these moments he may have
written these somewhat querulous remarks.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>TIME: PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Harris, in his <i>Hermes</i>, in his disquisition on Time, gives
the distinction between the grammatical or conventional
phrase, “Present Time,” and the more philosophical and
abstract “Now,” or “Instant.” Quoting Nicephorus Blemmides,
Harris would define the former as follows: “Present
Time is that which adjoins to the Real Now, or Instant, on
either side being a limited time made up of Past and Future;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>and from its vicinity to that Real Now, said to be Now also
itself.” Whilst upon the latter term he remarks: “As every
Now or Instant always exists in Time, and without being
Time is Time’s bound; the Bound of Completion to the
Past, and the Bound of Commencement to the Future; and
from hence we may conceive its nature or end, which is to
be the medium of continuity between the Past and the Future,
so as to render Time, through all its parts, one Intire
and Perfect Whole.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Thus, logically, “Time Present” must be regarded as a
mathematical point, having no parts or magnitude, being
simply the end of the Past, and the beginning of the Future.
Thus, perishing in action and eluding the grasp of
thought, it is a nonentity, of which, at best, an intangible
and shadowy existence can be predicated:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>Dum loquimur fugerit invida</div>
      <div class='line'>Ætas.                            <i>Hor.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>And we may ask of it, with its <i>carpe diem</i>, its manifold attributes,
and imputed influences, as the poet Young does of
the King of Terrors:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Why start at Death? Where is he? Death <i>arrived</i></div>
      <div class='line'>Is <i>past;</i> not <i>come</i>, or <i>gone</i>, he’s never <i>here</i>.</div>
      <div class='c022'><i>Night Thoughts</i>, iv.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>It is, however, in the more conventional sense that the
phrase “Present Time” is generally made use of in writing
and conversation. So Johnson, in his well-known passage:
“Whatever withdraws us from the power of our senses,
whatever makes the <i>past</i>, the <i>distant</i>, or the <i>future</i>, predominate
over the <i>present</i>, advances us in the dignity of thinking
beings,” &amp;c. Here we have “the Present” invested with
the dignity of individual existence, and compared with the
Past and the Future, as having duration or extension with
these; as if we should speak of a series of numbers, ascending
on each side of nothing to infinity, as being divisible
into negative, zero, and positive.</p>

<p class='c021'>Among coincident forms of expression, on the part of
writers who have spoken of the “Present Time” in its more
precise and philosophical sense, is the following by Cowley,
in a note to one of his “Pindarique Odes:” “There are two
sorts of Eternity; from the Present backwards to Eternity,
and from the present forwards, called by the Schoolmen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span><i>Æternitas à parte ante</i>, and <i>Æternitas à parte post</i>. These
two make up the whole circle of Eternity, which <i>Present
Time</i> cuts like a <i>Diameter</i>.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Carlyle, in his <i>Essays</i> (“Signs of the Times”), has this
knowledgeful passage: “We admit that the present is an
important time; as all present time necessarily is. <i>The
poorest day that passes over us is the conflux of two Eternities</i>,
and is made up of currents that issue from the remotest
Past, and flow onwards into the remotest Future. We were
wise, indeed, could we discover truly the signs of our own
times; and, by knowledge of its wants and advantages,
wisely adjust our own position in it. Let us, then, instead
of gazing idly into the obscure distance, look calmly around
us for a little on the perplexed scene where we stand. Perhaps,
on a more serious inspection, something of its perplexity
may disappear, some of its distinctive characters
and deeper tendencies more clearly reveal themselves;
whereby our own relations to it, our own true aims and
endeavours in it, may also become clearer.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c025'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <h3 class='c012'>MEASUREMENT OF TIME.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Sir Thomas Browne, treating of Errors regarding Numbers,
observes: “True it is that God made all things in
number, weight, and measure; yet nothing by them, or
through the efficacy of either. Indeed, our days, actions,
and motions being measured by time (which is but <i>motion
measured</i>), whatever is observable in any, falls under the
account of some number; which, notwithstanding, cannot
be denominated the cause of these events. So do we unjustly
assign the power of action even unto time itself; nor
do they speak properly who say that time consumeth all
things; for time is not effective, nor are bodies destroyed by
it, but from the action and passion of their elements in it;
whose account it only affordeth, and, measuring out their motion,
informs us in the periods and terms of their duration,
rather than effecteth or physically produceth the same.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c025'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Time can only be measured by motion: were all things
inanimate or fixed, time could not be measured. A body
cannot be in two places at the same instant; and if the motion
of any body from one point to another were regular and
equal, the divisions and subdivisions of the space thus
marked over would mark portions of time.</p>

<p class='c021'>The sun and the moon have served to divide portions of
time in all ages. The rising and setting of the sun, the
shortening and lengthening of the shadows of trees, and
even the shadow of man himself, have marked the flight of
time. The phases of the moon were used to indicate greater
portions; and a certain number of full moons supplied us
with the means of giving historical dates.</p>

<p class='c021'>Fifteen geographical miles, east or west, make one minute
of time. The earth turning on its axis produces the
alternate succession of day and night, and in this revolution
marks the smallest division of time by distances on its
surface.</p>

<p class='c021'>If each of the 360 degrees into which the circumference
of the earth is divided, be subdivided into twenty-four hours,
it will be found that 15 degrees pass under the sun during
each hour, which proves that 15 degrees of longitude mark
one hour of time: thus, as Berlin is nearly 15 degrees east
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>of London, it is almost one o’clock when it is twelve at
London.</p>

<p class='c021'>Time, like bodies, is divisible nearly <i>ad infinitum</i>. A
second (a mere pulsation) is divided into four or five parts,
marked by the vibrations of a watch-balance; and each of
these divisions is frequently required to be lessened an exact
2880th part of its momentary duration. It is, however, impossible
to see this; for Mr. Babbage, speaking of a piece
of mechanism which indicated the 300th part of a second,
tells us that both himself and friend endeavoured to stop
it twenty times successively at the same point, but could
not be confident of even the 20th part of a second.</p>

<p class='c021'>It has been said that many simple operations would
astonish us, did we but know enough to be so; and this
remark may not be inapplicable to those who, having a
watch losing half a minute per day, wish it corrected, though
they may not reflect that as half a minute is the 2880th
part of 24 hours, each vibration of the balance, which is only
the fifth part of a second, must be accelerated the 2880th
part of its instantaneous duration; while to make a watch,
losing one minute per week, go correctly, each vibration
must be accelerated the 1008th part of its duration, or the
50,400th part of a second.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c025'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Among the early methods of measuring Time, we must
not omit to notice Alfred’s “Time-Candles,” as they have
been called. His reputed biographer, Asser, tells us that
Alfred caused six tapers to be made for his daily use: each
taper, containing twelve pennyweights of wax, was twelve
inches long, and of proportionate breadth. The whole
length was divided into twelve parts, or inches, of which
three would burn for one hour, so that each taper would
be consumed in four hours; and the six tapers, being
lighted one after the other, lasted twenty-four hours. But
the wind blowing through the windows and doors and
chinks of the walls of the chapel, or through the cloth of
his tent, in which they were burning, wasted these tapers,
and consequently they burnt with no regularity; he therefore
designed a lantern made of ox or cow horn, cut into
thin plates, in which he enclosed the tapers; and thus protecting
them from the wind, the period of their burning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>became a matter of certainty. But the genuineness of Asser’s
work is doubted,—so the story is discredited. Nevertheless,
there is nothing very questionable in Alfred’s reputed
method; and it is curious to see that an “improvement”
was patented so recently as 1859, which consists in graduating
the exterior of candles, either by indentation or colouring
at intervals, and equal distances apart, according to the
size of the candles. The marks are to consist of hours,
half-hours, and, if necessary, quarter-hours; the distance to
be determined by the kind of candle used.</p>

<p class='c021'>Bishop Wilkins, in his <i>Mathematical Magic</i>, in the chapter
relating to “such engines as did receive a regular and
lasting motion from something belonging to their own
frame, whether weights or springs, &amp;c.,” quotes Pancirollus,
“taken from that experiment in the multiplication
of wheels mentioned in Vitruvius, where he speaks of an
instrument whereby a man may know how many miles or
paces he doth go in any space of time, whether or no he
pass by water in a boat or ship, or by land in a chariot or
coach. They have been contrived also into little pocket
instruments, by which, after a man hath walked a whole
day together, he may easily know how many steps he hath
taken.” More curious is “the alarum, mentioned by Walchius,
which, though it were but two or three inches big, yet
would both wake a man and of itself light a candle for him
at any set hour of the night. And those great springs, which
are of so great force as to turn a mill (as some have contrived),
may be easily applied to more various and difficult
labours.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Occasionally, in these old curiosities, we trace anticipations
of some of the scientific marvels of the present day.
Thus, when the Grand Duke of Tuscany, in 1669, visited
the Royal Society at Arundel House, he was shown “a
clock, whose movements are derived from the vicinity of a
loadstone; and it is so adjusted as to discover the distance
of countries, at sea, by the longitude.” The analogy between
this clock and the electrical clock of the present day is not
a little remarkable. The Journal-book of the Society for 1669
contains many allusions to “Hook’s magnetic watch going
slower or faster according to the greater or less distance of
the loadstone, and so moving regularly in every posture.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>On the occasion of the visit of illustrious strangers, this
clock and Hook’s magnetic watches were always exhibited
as great curiosities.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c025'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>PERIODS OF REST.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The terrestrial day, and consequently the length of the
cycle of light and darkness, being what it is, we find various
parts of the constitution both of animals and vegetables
which have a periodical character in their functions, corresponding
to the diurnal succession of external conditions;
and we find that the length of the period, as it exists in their
constitution, coincides with the length of the natural day.</p>

<p class='c021'>Man, in all nations and ages, takes his principal rest
once in twenty-four hours; and the regularity of this practice
seems most suitable to his health, though the duration
of the time allotted to repose is extremely different in different
cases. So far as we can judge, this period is of a
length beneficial to the human frame, independently of the
effect of external agents. In the voyages made into high
northern latitudes, where the sun did not rise for three
months, the crews of the ships were made to adhere, with
the utmost punctuality, to the habit of retiring to rest at
nine, and rising a quarter before six; and they enjoyed,
under circumstances apparently the most trying, a state of
salubrity quite remarkable. This shows that, according to
the common constitution of such men, the cycle of twenty-fours
is very commodious, though not imposed on them by
external circumstances.</p>

<p class='c021'>The succession of exertion and repose in the muscular
system, of excited and dormant sensibility in the nervous,
appears to be fundamentally connected with the muscular
and nervous powers, whatever the nature of these may be.
The necessity of these alternations is one of the measures
of the intensity of these vital energies; and it would seem
that we cannot, without assuming the human powers to be
altered, suppose the intervals of tranquillity which they require
to be much changed. This view agrees with the opinion
of the most eminent physiologists. Thus, Cabanis notices
the periodical and isochronous character of the desire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of sleep, as well as of other appetites. He states that sleep
is more easy and more salutary, in proportion as we go to
rest and rise every day at the same hours; and observes that
this periodicity seems to have a reference to the motions of
the solar system.</p>

<p class='c021'>Now, how should such a reference be at first established
in the constitution of man, animals, and plants, and transmitted
from one generation of them to another? If we suppose
a wise and benevolent Creator, by whom all the parts
of nature were fitted to their uses and to each other, this is
what we might expect and understand. On any other supposition,
such a fact appears altogether incredible and inconceivable.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c025'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>RECKONING DISTANCE BY TIME.</h3>

<p class='c023'>In Oriental countries, it has been the custom from the
earliest ages to reckon distances by <i>time</i>, rather than by any
direct reference to a standard of measure, as is commonly
reckoned in the present day. In the Scriptures we find distances
described by “a day’s journey,” “three days’ journey,”
and other similar expressions. A day’s journey is supposed
to have been equal to about thirty-three British statute
miles, and denoted the distance that could be performed
without any extraordinary fatigue by a foot-passenger; “a
Sabbath day’s journey” was peculiar to the Jews, being equal
to rather less than one statute mile. It may not be in exact
accordance with our habits of thought, and usual forms of
expression, thus to describe distances by time; yet it seems
to possess some advantages. A man knowing nothing of
the linear standards of measure employed in foreign countries,
would receive no satisfactory information on being
told that a particular city, or town, was distant from another
a certain number of miles<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c025'><sup>[6]</sup></a> or leagues,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c025'><sup>[7]</sup></a> as the case might
happen to be. But if he were told that such city or town
was distant from another a certain number of <i>hours</i> or <i>days</i>,
there would be something in the account that would commend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>itself to his understanding. A sea-voyage is oftener
described by reference to time than to <i>distance</i>. We frequently
hear persons inquire how many <i>weeks</i> or <i>months</i> it
will occupy to proceed to distant parts of the world, but
they rarely manifest any great anxiety about the number of
<i>miles</i>. This mode of computation seems especially applicable
to steam navigation: a voyage by a steam-packet,
under ordinary circumstances, being performed with such
surprising regularity, that it might, with greater propriety,
be described by minutes, or hours, or days, than by miles.</p>

<hr class='c026' />

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c021'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. In Holland a <i>mile</i> is nearly equal to three and three-quarters; in Germany
it is rather more than four and a half; and in Switzerland it is about equal to
five and three-quarters British miles.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c021'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. A <i>league</i> in France is equal to two and three-quarters; in Spain to four; in
Denmark to four and three-quarters; in Switzerland to five and a half; and in
Sweden to six and three-quarters British miles.</p>
</div>

<hr class='c027' />
<h3 class='c012'>SUN-DIALS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Sun-dials are little regarded but as curiosities in these
days; although the science of constructing Sun-dials, under
the name of Gnomonics, was, up to a comparatively recent
period, part of a mathematical course. As long as watches
were scarce, and clocks not very common, the dial was an
actual time-keeper. Of the mathematical works of the seventeenth
century which are found on book-stalls, none are so
common as those on Dialling.</p>

<p class='c021'>Each of the old dials usually had its monitory inscription;
and although the former have mostly disappeared,
the mottoes have been preserved, so that all their good is
not lost.</p>

<p class='c021'>The stately city of Oxford, which Waagen declared it
was worth a special journey from Germany to see, has, upon
its churches and colleges, and in their lovely gardens, several
dials. Christopher Wren, when a boy of fifteen at Wadham
College, designed on the ceiling of a room a reflecting dial,
embellished with various devices and two figures, Astronomy
and Geometry, with accessories, tastefully drawn with
a pen, and bearing a Latin inscription; but his more elaborate
work is the large and costly dial which he erected
at All Souls’ College, of which he was a Fellow.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Rev. W. Lisle Bowles was a sincere respecter of
dials. In the garden of his parsonage at Bremhill he placed
a Sun-dial—a small antique twisted column, gray with age,
and believed to have been the dial of the abbot of Malmesbury,
and counted his hours at the adjoining lodge; for it
was taken from the garden of the farmhouse, which had originally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>been the summer retirement of this mitred lord: it
is of monastic character, but a more ornate capital has been
added, which bears the date of 1688; it has the following
inscription by the venerable Canon:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To count the brief and unreturning hours,</div>
      <div class='line'>This Sun-dial was placed among the flowers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which came forth in their beauty—smiled and died,</div>
      <div class='line'>Blooming and withering round its ancient side.</div>
      <div class='line'>Mortal, thy day is passing—see that Flower,</div>
      <div class='line'>And think upon the Shadow and the Hour.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>From beneath a venerable yew, which has seen the persecution
of the loyal English clergy, you look into the adjoining
churchyard of Bremhill, on an old Sun-dial, once a cross.
Bowles tells us: “The <i>cross</i> was found broken at its foot,
probably by the country iconoclasts of the day. I have
brought the interesting fragment again into light, and placed
it conspicuously opposite to an old Scotch fir in the churchyard,
which I think it not unlikely was planted by Townson
on his restoration. The accumulation of the soil of
centuries had covered an ascent of four steps at the bottom
of this record of silent hours. These steps have been worn
in places, from the act of frequent prostration or kneeling
by the forefathers of the hamlet, perhaps before the church
existed.” Upon this old dial Bowles wrote one of his most
touching poems, of which these are the opening verses:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So passes silent o’er the dead thy shade,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Brief Time! and hour by hour, and day by day,</div>
      <div class='line'>The pleasing pictures of the present fade,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And like a summer-vapour steal away.</div>
    </div>

      <div class='line'>And have not they, who here forgotten lie</div>
      <div class='line in4'>(Say, hoary chronicler of ages past),</div>
      <div class='line'>Once more the shadow with delighted eye,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Nor thought it fled,—how certain and how fast?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Since thou hast stood, and thus thy vigil kept,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Noting each hour, o’er mould’ring stones beneath,</div>

      <div class='line in4'>And “dust to dust” proclaim’d the stride of death.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Any thing that reminds us of the lapse of time should
remind us also of the right employment of time in doing
whatever business is required to be done.</p>

<p class='c021'>A similar lesson is solemnly conveyed in the Scripture
motto to a Sun-dial: “The night cometh, when no man can
work.” Another solemn injunction is conveyed in the motto
to a Sun-dial erected by Bishop Copleston in a village near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>which he resided: “Let not the sun go down upon your
wrath” (<i>Ephesians</i> iv. 26).</p>

<p class='c021'>A more subtle motto is, “Septem sine horis;” signifying
that there are in the longest day seven hours (and a trifle
over) during which the Sun-dial is useless.</p>

<p class='c021'>Upon the public buildings and in the pleasure-grounds
of Old London the Sun-dial was placed as a silent monitor to
those who were sailing on the busy stream of time through
its crowded haunts and thoroughfares, or seeking meditation
in quiet nooks and plaisances of its river mansions and garden-houses.
Upon churches the dial commonly preceded the
clock: Wren especially introduced the dial in his churches.</p>

<p class='c021'>Sovereigns and statesmen may have reflected beside the
palace-dials upon the fleetingness of life, and thus have
learned to take better note of time. Whitehall was famous
for its Sun-dials. In Privy Garden was a dial set up by
Edward Gunter, professor of astronomy at Gresham College
(and of which he published a description), by command of
James I., in 1624. A large stone pedestal bore four dials at
the four corners, and “the great horizontal concave” in the
centre; besides east, west, north, and south dials at the sides.
In the reign of Charles II. this dial was defaced by an intoxicated
nobleman of the Court; upon which Marvell wrote:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>This place for a dial was too unsecure,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Since a guard and a garden could not defend;</div>
      <div class='line'>For so near to the Court they will never endure</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Any witness to show how their time they misspend.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>In the court-yard facing the Banqueting-house was another
curious dial, set up in 1669 by order of Charles II. It
was invented by one Francis Hall, <i>alias</i> Lyne, a Jesuit, and
professor of mathematics at Liège. This dial consisted of
five stages rising in a pyramidal form, and bearing several
vertical and reclining dials, globes cut into planes, and
glass bowls; showing, “besides the houres of all kinds,”
“many things also belonging to geography, astrology, and
astronomy, by the sun’s shadow made visible to the eye.”
Among the pictures were portraits of the king, the two
queens, the Duke of York, and Prince Rupert. Father Lyne
published a description of this dial, which consists of
seventy-three parts: it is illustrated with seventeen plates:
the details are condensed in No. 400 of the <i>Mirror</i>. About
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>1710, William Allingham, a mathematician in Canon-row,
asked 500<i>l.</i> to repair this dial: it was last seen by Vertue,
the artist and antiquary, at Buckingham House.</p>

<p class='c021'>The bricky towers of St. James’s palace had their Sun-dials;
and in the gardens of Kensington palace and Hampton
Court palace are to this day superb dials.</p>

<p class='c021'>Upon a house-front in the Terrace, New Palace Yard,
Westminster, is a Sun-dial, having the motto from Virgil,
“Discite justitiam, moniti,” which had probably been inscribed
upon the old clock-tower of the palace, in reference
to its having been built with a fine that had been levied on
the Chief Justice of the King’s Bench for altering a record.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Inns of Court, where time runs its golden sand, have
retained a few of their Sun-dials. In Lincoln’s Inn, on two
of the old gables, are: 1. A southern dial, restored in 1840,
which shows the hours by its gnomon, from 6 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> to 4 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>,
and is inscribed, “Ex hoc monumento pendet æternitas.”
2. A western dial, restored in 1794 and 1848, from the different
situation of its plane, only shows the hours from
noon till night: inscription, “Quam redit nescitis horam.”
And in Serle’s-court (now New-square), on the west side,
was a dial inscribed, “Publica privatis secernite, sacra prophanis.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Gray’s Inn has lost its Sun-dials: but in the gardens
was a dial, opposite Verulam Buildings, not far from Bacon’s
summer-house; and the turret of the great Hall had formerly
a southern declining dial, with this motto, “Lux diei,
lex Dei.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Furnival’s Inn had its garden and dial, which disappeared
when the old Inn buildings were taken down in
1818, and the Inn rebuilt.</p>

<p class='c021'>Staple Inn had upon its Hall a well-kept dial, above a
luxuriant fig-tree.</p>

<p class='c021'>Clement’s Inn had, in its small garden, a kneeling figure
supporting a dial,—one of the leaden garden embellishments
common in the last century. In New Inn, adjoining,
the Hall has a large vertical Sun-dial, motto: “Time and
Tide tarry for no man.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Lyon’s Inn, which had been an Inn “since 1420, or
sooner,” had, in 1828, an old Sun-dial, which had lost its
gnomon and most of its figures.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>The Temple garden, Inner and Middle, has each a large
pillar Sun-dial; the latter very handsome. There are vertical
dials in various courts; but the old dial of Inner Temple
terrace, with its “Begone about your business,”—in
reality the reply of a testy bencher to the painter who
teased him for an inscription,—disappeared in the year
1828. There remain three dials with mottoes: Temple-lane,
“Pereunt et imputantur;” Essex-court, “Vestigia nulla retrorsum;”
Brick-court, “Time and tide tarry for no man;”
and in Pump-court and Garden-court are two dials without
mottoes. Charles Lamb has this charmingly reflective passage,
suggested by the Temple dials:</p>

<p class='c028'>What an antique air had the now almost effaced sun-dials, with
their moral inscriptions, seeming coevals with that Time which they
measured, and to take their revelations of its flight immediately from
heaven, holding correspondence with the fountain of light! How could
the dark line steal imperceptibly on, watched by the eye of childhood,
eager to detect its movement, never catched, nice as an evanescent
cloud, or the first arrests of sleep!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And yet doth beauty like a dial-hand</div>
      <div class='line'>Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c030'>What a dead thing is a clock, with its ponderous embowelments of
lead and brass, its pert or solemn dulness of communication, compared
with the simple altar-like structure and silent heart-language of the
old dial! It stood as the garden god of Christian gardens. Why is it
almost every where vanished? If its business be superseded by more
elaborate inventions, its moral uses, its beauty, might have pleaded for
its continuance. It spoke of moderate labours, of pleasures not protracted
after sunset, of temperance and good hours. It was the primitive
clock, the horologe of the first world. Adam could scarce have
missed it in Paradise. It was the measure appropriate for sweet plants
and flowers to spring by, for the birds to apportion their silver warblings
by, for flocks to pasture and be led to fold by. The shepherd ‘carved
it out quaintly in the sun,’ and, turning philosopher by the very occupation,
provided it with mottoes more touching than tombstones. It
was a pretty device of the gardener, recorded by Marvell, who, in the
days of artificial gardening, made a dial out of herbs and flowers:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>How well the skilful gardener drew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of herbs and flowers, this dial new!</div>
      <div class='line'>Where from above, the milder sun</div>
      <div class='line'>Does through a fragrant zodiac run:</div>
      <div class='line'>And, as it works, the industrious bee</div>
      <div class='line'>Computes its time as well as we.</div>
      <div class='line'>How could such sweet and wholesome hours</div>
      <div class='line'>Be reckon’d, but with herbs and flowers?</div>
      <div class='c022'><i>From “The Garden.”</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Another noted dial gave name to a locality of the metropolis,
which has known many mutations, viz. Seven Dials,
built in the time of Charles II. for wealthy tenants. Evelyn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>notes, 1694: “I went to see the building near St. Giles’s,
where Seven Dials make a star from a Doric pillar placed in
the middle of a circular area, said to be by Mr. Neale (the
introducer of the late lotteries), in imitation of Venice, now
set up here for himself twice, and once for the state.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Where famed St. Giles’s ancient limits spread,</div>
      <div class='line'>An in-rail’d column rears its lofty head:</div>
      <div class='line'>Here to seven streets seven dials count their day,</div>
      <div class='line'>And from each other catch the circling ray:</div>
      <div class='line'>Here oft the peasant, with inquiring face,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bewilder’d trudges on from place to place;</div>
      <div class='line'>He dwells on every sign with stupid gaze,</div>
      <div class='line'>Enters the narrow alleys’ doubtful maze,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tries every winding court and street in vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And doubles o’er his weary steps again.</div>
      <div class='c022'>Gay’s <i>Trivia</i>, book ii.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The seven streets were Great and Little Earl, Great and
Little White Lion, Great and Little St. Andrew’s, and Queen;
though the dial-stone had but six faces, two of the streets
opening into one angle. The column and dials were removed
in June 1773, to search for a treasure said to be concealed
beneath the base. They were never replaced; but in
1822 were purchased of a stone-mason, and the column was
surmounted with a ducal coronet, and set up on Weybridge
Green as a memorial to the late Duchess of York, who died
at Oatlands in 1820. The dial-stone is now a stepping-stone
at the adjoining Ship inn.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c025'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>The Sun-dial was also formerly used with a compass.
The Hon. Robert Boyle relates, “that a Boatman one day
took out of his pocket a little Sun-dial, furnished with an
excited needle to direct how to set it, such dials being used
among mariners, not only to show them the hour of the day,
but to inform them from what quarter the wind blows.”</p>

<p class='c021'>A Cape Town Correspondent of <i>Notes and Queries</i> describes
a Sun-dial and compass in his possession, made by
“Johann Willebrand, in Augsburg, 1848:” it has a curious
perpetual calendar attached, and is of highly finished work
in silver, parcel-gilt. Another Sun-dial and compass is mentioned
as made by Butterfield, at Paris: it is small, of silver,
and horizontal; upon its face are engraved dials for several
latitudes, and at the back a table of principal cities; it is
set by a compass, and the gnomon adjusted by a divided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>arc. The N. point of the compass-box is <i>fixed</i> in a position
to allow for variation, probably at Paris; and, judging from
this, it would appear to have been made about 1716.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c025'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>We should also notice the pocket ring-dial, such as that
which gave occasion to the Fool in the Forest of Arden to
“moral on the time:”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And then he drew a dial from his poke,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>Says, very wisely, “It is ten o’clock.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>This is a ring of brass, much like a miniature dog-collar, and
has, moving in a groove in its circumference, a narrower
ring with a boss, pierced by a small hole to admit a ray of
light. The latter ring is made movable, to allow for the
varying declination of the sun in the several months of the
year, and the initials of these are marked in the ascending
and descending scale on the larger ring, which bears also
the motto:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Set me right, and use me well,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I y<sup>e</sup> time to you will tell.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>The hours are lined and numbered on the opposite concavity.
When the boss of the sliding ring is set, and the
ring is suspended by the ring directly towards the sun, a
ray of light passing through the hole in the boss impinges
on the concave surface, and the hour is told with fair accuracy.
Mr. Thomas Q. Couch, of Bodmin, thus describes this
Dial in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 3d series, No. 36. Mr. Charles
Knight, in his <i>Pictorial Shakspeare</i>, has engraved a dial of
this kind, as an illustration of <i>As you like it</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Redmond, of Liverpool, describes the old pocket
ring-dial as common in the county of Wexford some twenty-five
years ago: there was hardly a farm-house where one
could not be had. The same Correspondent of <i>Notes and
Queries</i>, 3d series, No. 39, describes a door-sill marked with
the hour for every day in the year: the sill had a full
southern aspect, so that when the sun shone, the time could
be read as correctly as by any watch.</p>

<p class='c021'>Another Correspondent of <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 2d series,
No. 38, has an ingenious pocket-dial, sold by one T. Clarke:
it is merely a card, with a small plummet hanging by a
thread, and a gnomon, which lies flat on the card, but, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>lifted up, casts the shadow to indicate the hour of the day,
and also the hours of sunrise and sunset.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the United Service Museum, Whitehall, is a Sun-dial,
with a burning-glass arranged to fire a small gun at
noon; also a large Universal Dial, with a circle showing
minutes; and another large Universal Dial, with horizontal
plate and spirit-level.</p>

<p class='c021'>Suppose we collect a few of the monitory inscriptions on
dials in various places. Hazlitt, in a graceful paper “On
a Sun-dial,” tells us that</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Horas non numero nisi serenas</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>is the motto of a Sun-dial near Venice; and the same line
is painted in huge letters over the Sun-dial in front of an
old farmhouse near Farnworth, in Lancashire.</p>

<p class='c021'>At Hebden Bridge, in Yorkshire, is this quaint motto:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Quod petis, umbra est.</div>
    </div>

</div>

<p class='c021'>Canon Bowles, in his love of the solemn subject, prescribed
the following, with paraphrastic translations:</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'><i>Morning Sun.</i>—Tempus volat.</div>

      <div class='line in2'><i>Noon.</i>—Dum tempus habemus, operemur bonum.</div>
      <div class='line'>Life steals away—this hour, oh! man, is lent thee.</div>

<p class='c021'>In Brading churchyard, Isle of Wight, on a Sun-dial fixed
to what appears originally to have been part of a churchyard
cross, is the motto:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hora pars vitæ.</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Butler has this couplet:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>True as the dial to the sun,</div>
      <div class='line'>Although it be not shin’d upon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
      <div class='c022'><i>Hudibras</i>, part iii. canto 2.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Upon this Dr. Nash notes: “As the dial is invariable, and
always open to the sun whenever its rays can show the
time of day, though the weather is often cloudy, and obscures
its lustre: so true loyalty is always ready to serve
its king and country, though it often suffers great afflictions
and distresses.”</p>

<p class='c021'>There cannot be a more faithful indicator, according to
Barton Booth’s song:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>True as the needle to the pole,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or as the dial to the sun.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>After all, the <i>sun</i>-dial is but an occasional timekeeper;
a defect which the pious Bishop Hall ingeniously illustrates
in the following beautiful Meditation “On the Sight
of a Dial:” “If the sun did not shine upon this dial, nobody
would look at it: in a cloudy day it stands like an useless
post, unheeded, unregarded; but, when once those beams
break forth, every passenger runs to it, and gazes on it.</p>

<p class='c021'>“O God, while thou hidest thy countenance from me,
methinks all thy creatures pass by me with a willing neglect.
Indeed, what am I without thee? And if thou have
drawn in me some lines and notes of able endowments;
yet, if I be not actuated by thy grace, all is, in respect of
use, no better than nothing; but when thou renewest the
light of thy loving countenance upon me, I find a sensible
and happy change of condition: methinks all things look
upon me with such cheer and observance, as if they meant
to make good that word of thine, <i>Those that honour me, I
will honour:</i> now, every line and figure, which it hath
pleased thee to work in me, serve for useful and profitable
direction. O Lord, all the glory is thine. Give thou me
light: I will give others information: both of us shall give
thee praise.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The Pyramids of Egypt, the most ancient and the most
colossal structures on the earth,—the purpose and appropriation
of which has been much controverted by antiquaries
and men of science,—have been considered by some to
have served as Sun-dials. Sir Gardner Wilkinson does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>pretend to explain the real object for which these stupendous
monuments were constructed, but feels persuaded that
they have served for tombs, and have also been intended
for astronomical purposes. “The form of the exterior might
lead to many useful calculations. They stand exactly due
north and south; and while the direction of the faces to
the east and west might serve to fix the return of a certain
period of the year, the shadow cast by the sun, or the time
of its coinciding with their slope, might be observed for a
similar purpose.”</p>

<p class='c021'>There is an interesting association of the Great Pyramid
with the ambitious dream of one of the world’s celebrities,
which may be noticed here. When Napoleon I.
was in Egypt, in 1799, he rode on a camel to the Great
Pyramid and the Sphinx, that relic of mystic grandeur.
Karl Girardet has painted this impressive visit; and the
picture has been engraved by Gautier, and inscribed, “Forty
Centuries look down upon him.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Charles Mackay has written a graceful poem as a pendent
to this print; in which the poet makes the young Napoleon
thus invoke the colossal monuments:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c020'>

<p class='c028'>It is the apex of a richly-ornamented pedestal, which rests upon a
hexagonal base, consisting of three steps. The form of the ‘horologe’ is
multangular; for though its principal sections are pentagonal, yet from
their terminating in pyramidal points, and being diametrically opposed
to each other, again connected by triangular interspaces, it presents no
fewer than twenty sides, on which are placed twenty-two dials, inserted
into circular, semicircular, and triangular cavities. Between the dials
are the royal arms of Scotland, with the initials M. R., St. Andrew, St.
George, <i>fleurs-de-lis</i>, and other emblems. This memorial carries us back
nearly three centuries, when Holyrood was a palace</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE HOUR-GLASS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The use of the Hour-glass can be traced to ancient
Greece. In Christie’s Greek Vases, one is engraved from a
scarabæus of sardonyx, in the Towneley collection: it is
exactly like the modern hour-glass. The first mention of it
occurs in a Greek tragedian named Bato. On a bas-relief
of the Mattei Palace, of the marriage of Thetis and Peleus,
Morpheus holds an hour-glass; and from Athenæus it appears
that persons, when going out, carried it about with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>them, as we do a watch. In a woodcut in Hawkins’s <i>History
of Music</i>, the frame is more solid, and the glass probably
slipped in and out. There is another cut of one in Boissard,
held by Death, precisely of the modern form.</p>

<p class='c021'>The hour or sand-glass is liable to the objection, that it
requires a horary attendant, as is intimated in the glee:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Five times by the taper’s light</div>
      <div class='line'>The hour-glass we have turned to-night.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>But the Hour-glass is a better measurer of time than is
generally imagined. The flow of the sand from one bulb
to another is perfectly equable, whatever may be the quantity
of sand above the aperture. The stream flows no faster
when the upper bulb is almost full than when it is almost
empty; the lower heap not being influenced by the pressure
of the heap above.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c025'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Bloomfield, in one of his rural tales,
“The Widow to her Hour-glass,” sings:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I’ve often watched thy streaming sand,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And seen the growing mountain rise,</div>
      <div class='line'>And often found life’s hope to stand</div>
      <div class='line in4'>On props as weak in wisdom’s eyes:</div>
      <div class='line in13'>Its conic crown</div>
      <div class='line in13'>Still sliding down,</div>
      <div class='line'>Again heaped up, then down again:</div>
      <div class='line in4'>The sand above more hollow grew,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Like days and years still filtering through,</div>
      <div class='line'>And mingling joy and pain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Ford, contemporary with Massinger, has this impressive
picture of the primitive time-keeper:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Minutes are number’d by the fall of sands,</div>
      <div class='line'>As, by an hour-glass, the span of time</div>
      <div class='line'>Doth waste us to our graves; and we look on it.</div>
      <div class='line'>An age of pleasures, revell’d out, comes home</div>
      <div class='line'>At last, and ends in sorrow: but the life,</div>
      <div class='line'>Weary of riot, numbers every sand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wailing in sighs, until the last drop down;</div>
      <div class='line'>So to conclude calamity in rest: numbering wasted life.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>How cleverly the old dramatist, Shirley, illustrates this
philosopher in glass:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>Let princes gather</div>
      <div class='line'>My dust into a glass, and learn to spend</div>
      <div class='line'>Their hour of state, that’s all they have; for when</div>
      <div class='line'>That’s out, Time never turns the glass again.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The Hour-glass has almost entirely given place to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>more useful, because to a greater extent self-acting, instrument;
and it is now seldom seen except upon the table of
the lecturer or private teacher, in the study of the philosopher,
in the cottage of the peasant, or in the hand of the old
emblematic figure of Time.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c025'><sup>[12]</sup></a> We still sometimes see it in the
workshop of the cork-cutter. The half-minute glass is still
employed on board ship; and the two and a half or three
minute glass for boiling an egg with exactness.</p>

<p class='c028'>Preaching by the Hour-glass was formerly common; and public speakers
are <i>timed</i>, in the present day, by the same means. In the church-wardens’
books of St. Helen’s, Abingdon, date 1599, is a charge of fourpence
for an hour-glass for the pulpit; in 1564, we find in the books
of St. Katherine’s, Christ Church, Aldgate, “paid for an hour-glass that
hangeth by the pulpit when the preacher doth make a sermon, that he
may know how the hour passeth away—one shilling;” and in the books
of St. Mary’s, Lambeth, 1579 and 1615, are similar entries. Butler, in
<i>Hudibras</i>, alludes to pulpit hour-glasses having been used by the Puritans:
the preacher having named the text, turned up the glass; and
if the sermon did not last till the sand was out, it was said by the congregation
that the preacher was lazy; but if, on the other hand, he
continued much longer, they would yawn and stretch till the discourse
was finished. At the old church of St. Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet-street,
was a large hour-glass in a silver frame, of which latter, when
the instrument was taken down, in 1723, two heads were made for the
parish staves. Hogarth, in his “Sleepy Congregation,” has introduced
an hour-glass on the west side of the pulpit. A very perfect hour-glass
is preserved in the church of St. Alban, Wood-street, Cheapside; it is
placed on the right of the reading-desk within a frame of twisted
columns and arches, supported on a spiral column: the four sides have
angels sounding trumpets; and each end has a line of crosses <i>patées</i>
and fleurs-de-lis, somewhat resembling the imperial crown.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CLOCKS AND WATCHES.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The clock was also the horologe of our old poets, from
the Latin <i>horologium:</i></p>
<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He’ll watch the horologe a double set,</div>
      <div class='line'>If drink rock not his cradle.—<i>Othello</i>, act ii. sc. 3.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Drayton calls the cock the country horologe.</p>

<p class='c021'>Rabelais thus capriciously ridicules the use of the clock:
“The greatest loss of time that I know, is to count the
hours. What good comes of it? Nor can there be any
greater dotage in the world, than for one to guide and direct
his course by the sound of a bell, and not by his own judgment
and discretion.” In similar exuberance has this gay
satirist said: “There is only one quarter of an hour in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>human life passed ill, and that is between the calling for
the reckoning and paying it.”</p>

<p class='c021'>With more serious purpose has Sir Walter Scott, in his
“Lay of the Imprisoned Huntsman,” thus anathematised
the clock and the dial:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I hate to learn the ebb of time</div>
      <div class='line'>From yon dull steeple’s drowsy chime,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or mark it as the sunbeams crawl</div>
      <div class='line'>Inch after inch along the wall.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Richard II., in the dungeon of Pomfret Castle, soliloquises
more solemnly:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Now hath Time made me his numb’ring clock:</div>
      <div class='line'>My thoughts are minutes, and with sighs they jade</div>
      <div class='line'>Their watches on to mine eyes, the outward watch</div>
      <div class='line'>Whereto my finger, like a dial’s point,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now, sir, the sound that tells what hour it is,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are clamorous groans, that strike upon my heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which is the bell: so sighs, and tears, and groans</div>
      <div class='line'>Show minutes, times, and hours.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Lucian, who died <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 180, refers to an instrument,
mechanically constructed with water, which reported the
hours by a bell. “Before the time of Jerome” (born <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>
332), says Browne, “there were horologies that measured
the hours, not only by drops of water in glasses, called
<i>clepsydra</i>, but also by sand in glasses, called <i>clepsummia</i>.”
It was the clepsydra to which Lucian alludes. When the
water, which was constantly dripping out of the vessel,
reached a certain level, it drew away, by means of a rope
connected with the piston in the water-vessel, the ledge on
which a weight rested; and the falling of this weight,
which was attached to a bell, caused it to strike. This,
perhaps, was the earliest kind of striking clock.</p>

<p class='c021'>A public striking clock may well be termed the regulator
of society: it reminds us of our engagements, and announces
the hours for exertion or repose; and in the silence of
night it tells us of the hours that are past, and how many
remain before day.</p>

<p class='c021'>The earliest public clock set up in England was that
with three bells, which was placed in the clochard or bell-tower
of the Palace at Westminster, built by Edward III.
in 1365-6: the palace was then the most frequent residence
of the king and his family; and the three bells were “usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>rung at Coronations, Triumphs, Funeralls of Princes,
and their Obits.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c025'><sup>[13]</sup></a> This bell-tower stood very near to the
site of the great clock-tower of the new palace; the gilding
of the exterior of which cost no less than 1500<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c021'>A public clock is a public monitor; and the dimensions
of its dial, and works, and striking-bell add much to the
solemnity of its proclaiming the march of time. The great
clocks in the International Exhibition of 1862 were among
its colossal marvels.</p>

<p class='c021'>The clocks of St. Paul’s Cathedral, Westminster Palace,
and the Royal Exchange, are three of the largest clocks in
London. The St. Paul’s hour-hands are the height of a
tall man; the hour struck by this clock has been heard at
midnight on the terrace of Windsor Castle; and from the
telegraph station on Putney-heath the hour has been read
by the St. Paul’s clock-face without the aid of a telescope:
the hour-numerals are 2 feet 2½ inches in height. This
clock once struck thirteen, which being heard by a sentinel,
accused of being asleep at his post at that hour, was the
means of saving his life; this striking thirteen was caused
by the lifting-piece holding on too long.</p>

<p class='c021'>The former church of St. Paul, Covent Garden, built by
Inigo Jones, contained within the pediment a pendulum-clock,
made by Richard Harris in 1641, and stated by an
inscription in the vestry to be the first pendulum-clock
made.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c025'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>The Horse Guards Clock is properly described by Mr.
Denison as “a superstitiously venerated and bad clock;”
it is minutely described by Mr. B. L. Vulliamy in the <i>Curiosities
of London</i>, pp. 378-380.</p>

<p class='c021'>St. James’s Palace Clock, made by Clay, clockmaker to
George II., strikes the hours and quarters upon three bells;
it requires to be wound up every day, and originally had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>but one hand. We were told by the late Mr. B. L. Vulliamy,
that when the gatehouse was repaired in 1831, the
clock was removed, and not put up again, on account of the
roof being reported unsafe to carry the weight. The inhabitants
of the neighbourhood then memorialised William
IV. for the replacement of the timekeeper: the King, having
ascertained its weight, shrewdly inquired how, if the tower-roof
was not strong enough to carry the clock, it was safe
for the number of persons occasionally seen upon it to witness
processions, &amp;c. The clock was forthwith replaced, and
a minute-hand was added, with new dials: the original dials
were of wainscot, in a great number of very small pieces
curiously dovetailed together.</p>

<p class='c021'>Trinity College, Cambridge, has a double-striking clock,
put up by the famous Dr. Bentley; striking, as it used to be
said, once for Trinity and once for his former college, St.
John’s, which had no clock.</p>

<p class='c021'>The clock of St. Clement’s Danes, in the Strand, strikes
twice; the hour being first struck on a larger bell, and then
repeated on a smaller one; so that if the first has been miscounted,
the second may be more correctly observed.</p>

<p class='c021'>Wren has introduced the gilt projecting dial in several
of the City churches: that at St. Magnus, London Bridge,
was the gift of Sir Charles Duncomb, who, it is related,
when a poor boy, had once to wait upon London Bridge a
considerable time for his master, whom he missed through
not knowing the hour; he then vowed that if ever he became
successful in the world, he would give to St. Magnus a
public clock, that passengers might see the time; and this
dial proves the fulfilment of his vow. It was originally ornamented
with several richly gilded figures: upon a small
metal shield inside the clock are engraven the donor’s arms,
with this inscription: “The gift of Sir Charles Duncomb,
Knight, Lord Major, and Alderman of this ward; Langley
Bradley fecit, 1709.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The former church of St. Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet-street,
within memory possessed one of London’s wonders:
it had a large gilt dial overhanging the street, and above it
two figures of savages, life-size, carved in wood, and standing
beneath a pediment, each having in his right hand a
club, with which he struck the quarters upon a suspended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>bell, moving his head at the same time. To see the men
strike was considered very attractive; and opposite St. Dunstan’s
was a famous field for pickpockets, who took advantage
of the gaping crowd. So it had long been; for Ned
Ward, in his <i>London Spy</i>, says: “We added to the number
of fools, and stood a little, making our ears do penance to
please our eyes, with the conceited notion of their (the
puppets’) heads and hands, which moved to and fro with as
much deliberate stiffness as the two wooden horologists at
St. Dunstan’s when they strike the quarters.” Cowper thus
describes them in his <i>Table-Talk:</i></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When labour and when dulness, club in hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like the two figures at St. Dunstan’s, stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>Beating alternately, in measur’d time,</div>
      <div class='line'>The clockwork tintinnabulum of rhyme,</div>
      <div class='line'>Exact and regular the sounds will be,</div>
      <div class='line'>But such mere quarter-strokes are not for me.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>These figures and the clock were put up in 1671. Among
those who were struck by their oddity was the third Marquis
of Hertford, born in 1777: “When a child, and a good
child, his nurse, to reward him, would take him to see <i>the
giants</i> at St. Dunstan’s; and he used to say that when he
grew to be a man <i>he would buy those giants</i>” (Cunningham’s
<i>Handbook of London</i>). Many a child of rich parents may
have used the same words; but in the present case the
Marquis kept his word. When the old church of St. Dunstan
was taken down, in 1830, Lord Hertford attended the
second auction-sale of the materials, and purchased the
clock, bells, and figures for 200<i>l.;</i> he had them placed at
the entrance to the grounds of his villa in the Regent’s
Park, thence called St. Dunstan’s Villa; and here the figures
do duty to the present day.</p>

<p class='c021'>These automata remind us of the Minute-Jacks in Shakspeare’s
<i>Timon of Athens</i>, generally interpreted as Jacks of
the Clock-house:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>You fools of fortune, trencher friends, time’s flies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Still, the Minute-Jacks only struck hours and quarters;
and the term is rather thought to mean “fellows that watch
their minutes to make their advantage, time-servers.” There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>is no doubt that by the “Jack that keeps the stroke,” in
<i>Richard III.</i>, is meant the Jack of the Clock-house.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c025'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>A much more noteworthy sight than the Fleet-street
clock-figures is possessed by the Londoners of the present
day in the Time-ball Signal upon the roof of the Electric
Telegraph Office, No. 448 West Strand.</p>

<p class='c028'>The signal consists of a zinc ball, 6 feet in diameter, supported by a
rod, which passes down the centre of a column, and carries at the base
a piston, which, in its descent, plunges into a cast-iron air-cylinder;
the escape of the air being regulated so as at pleasure to check the
momentum of the ball, and prevent concussion. The raising of the
ball, half-mast high, takes place daily at 10 minutes to 1 o’clock; at
5 minutes to 1 it is raised to the full height; and at 1 precisely, and
simultaneously with the fall of the Time-ball at Greenwich Observatory
(by which navigators correct their chronometers), it is liberated by the
galvanic current sent from the Observatory, through a wire laid for
that purpose. The same galvanic current which liberates the Ball in
the Strand moves a needle upon the transit-clock of the Observatory,
the time occupied by the transition being about 1-3000th part of a
second; and by the unloosing of the machinery which supports the
ball, less than one-fifth part of a second. The true moment of one
o’clock is therefore indicated by the first appearance of the line of
light between the dark cross over the ball and the body of the ball itself.
There is a similar Time-ball upon the roof of a clockmaker’s in Cornhill.</p>

<p class='c023'>At Edinburgh, also, is a Time-ball connected with a
Time-gun signal, consisting of a large iron cannon, in the
Half-moon Battery, at the Castle; which cannon, having
been duly loaded and primed some time between twelve and
one o’clock, is fired off precisely at the latter hour by an
electric influence from the corrected Mean-time of the Royal
Observatory, at a distance of three-quarters of a mile;
which, however, first passes to another clock close to the
gun, and thus affords a short fraction of a second <i>before</i> one
o’clock for the train of processes; so that the actual final
flash of the exploding gun in the Castle occurs absolutely
coincidently with the tick of the sixtieth second of the
corrected mean-time clock in the Royal Observatory. The
whole is well described by Professor Piazzi Smith, Astronomer-Royal
for Scotland, in <i>Good Words</i>, 1862, part iv.</p>

<p class='c021'>We now return to the details of the great London Clocks.
Mr. Dent undertook the construction of the Royal Exchange
Clock in 1843: it was required to be superior to any
public clock in England, and to satisfy certain conditions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>proposed for the first time by the Astronomer-Royal, and
such as could not be satisfied by any clock of the common
construction. Mr. Dent had then no factory of his own for
making large clocks, and he could not get the clock made
for him; “but with the energy and genius by which that
remarkable man raised himself from a tallow-chandler’s apprentice
to the position of the first horologist in the world,
he set up a factory for himself at a great expense, and made
the clock there; and of this, the first turret-clock he had
ever made, the Astronomer-Royal certified, in 1845, that it
not only satisfied his conditions, but that Mr. Dent had
made some judicious improvements upon his suggestions,
and that he had no doubt it was the best public clock in
the world.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c025'><sup>[16]</sup></a> It is true to a second of time, and has a compensation-pendulum.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Westminster Palace Clock, designed by Mr. Denison,
has four dials, each 22½ feet wide: they are not the largest
in the world, being considerably less than the dial at Mechlin;
but there is no other clock in the world which has to
work four dials of such great width, especially a clock going
8½ days. St. Paul’s Clock has only two 17-feet dials, and is
wound up every day, which makes a vast difference in the
power and strength required. Each pair of hands weighs
above 2 cwt.: they are made of gun-metal, instead of sheet-iron
or copper. The hour-sockets are iron tubes, 5 inches
in diameter; the dials are of cast-iron framework, filled with
opal glass, and stand out 5 feet from the main walls.</p>

<p class='c021'>The size of public dials is often very inadequate to their
height, and the distance at which they are intended to be
seen. They ought to be at least one foot in diameter for
every ten feet of height above the ground, and in many
cases more, whenever the dial will be seen far off. Now,
the clock-dials of St. Pancras, Euston-square, are but 6½
feet in diameter, though at the height of 100 feet, and therefore
are much too small.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Clock, of silver-gilt, presented by Henry VIII. to
Anne Boleyn on the morning of their marriage, is one of
the earliest chamber-clocks in the kingdom: the case is
richly chased and engraved, and on the weights are the
initial letters of Henry and Anne, with true-lovers’ knots.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>This clock was purchased at the Strawberry Hill sale in
the year 1842, for 110<i>l.</i>, and is now in the collection of
Queen Victoria.</p>

<p class='c021'>We may here mention that the late Duke of Sussex
possessed, at Kensington Palace, an invaluable collection
of the early as well as the most perfect specimens of Time-keepers,
among which was “Harrison’s first Clock, the
forerunner of that invaluable machine, without which the
compass itself would be but an imperfect guide to the
mariner.”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c025'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>John Harrison received for his improved chronometers, in 1749, the
Copley Medal; and, thus encouraged by the Royal Society, and by the
hope of sharing the reward of 20,000<i>l.</i> offered by Parliament for the
discovery of the longitude, Harrison produced in 1758 a time-keeper,
which was sent for trial on a voyage to Jamaica. After 161 days, the
error of the instrument was only one minute five seconds, and the
maker received from the nation 5000<i>l.</i> For other chronometers, subjected,
with perfect success, to a trial in a voyage to Barbadoes, Harrison
received 10,000<i>l.</i> more. Dr. Stukeley writes of this ingenious
man: “I passed by Mr. Harrison’s house at Barrow, that excellent
genius of clock-making, who bids fair for the golden prize for the discovery
of the longitude. I saw his famous clock last winter at Mr.
George Graham’s: the sweetness of its motion, the contrivances to
take off friction, to defeat the lengthening and shortening of the pendulum
through heat and cold, and to prevent the disturbance of motion
by that of the ship, cannot be sufficiently admired.”—<i>Ms. Journal.</i><a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c025'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c023'>An exact measure of time is of the utmost importance
to many of the sciences. Horology is indispensable to astronomy,
in which the variation even of two or three seconds
is of the greatest consequence. By means of a clock the
Danish astronomer, Roemer, was enabled to discover that
the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites took place a few seconds
later than he had calculated, when the earth was in that
part of its orbit the farthest from Jupiter. Speculating on
the cause of this phenomenon, he calculated that light was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>not propagated instantaneously, but took time to reach us;
and, from calculations founded on this theory, light has
been discovered to dart through space with a velocity of
about 192,000 miles in a second: thus, the light of the sun
takes eight minutes to reach the earth.</p>

<p class='c021'>Horology has also enabled us to discover that when the
wind passes one mile per hour, it is scarcely perceptible;
while at the rate of one hundred miles per hour it acquires
sufficient force to tear up trees, and destroy the produce of
the earth. And, without the aid of a seconds-clock, it would
have been scarcely possible to ascertain that a cannon-ball
flies at the rate of 600 feet in a second.</p>

<p class='c021'>The use of Chronometers in geography and navigation is
well known; since it is only necessary to ascertain the exact
difference in time between two places, to determine their
distance east or west of each other.</p>

<p class='c021'>Graham applied the motion of a Clock showing sidereal
time to make a telescope point in the direction of any particular
star, even when before the horizon.</p>

<p class='c021'>Alexander Cummins made a Clock for George III. which
registered the height of the barometer during every day
throughout the year. This was effected by a circular card,
of about 2 feet in diameter, being made to turn round once
in a year. The card was divided by radii lines into 365
divisions, the months and days of the month being marked
round the edge, while the usual range of the barometer
was indicated in inches and tenths by circular lines described
from the centre. A pencil with a fine point pressed
on the card by a spring, and, held by an upright rod floating
on the mercury, faithfully marked the state of the barometer;
the card, being carried forward by the clock, brought
each day to the pencil. Wren proposed to have a clock constructed
on a similar principle, to register the position and
force of the wind; which idea has been adopted.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the Armoury of George IV. was a model of a small
cannon, with a clock attached to the lock in such a manner
that the trigger could be discharged at any desired time by
setting the clock as an alarum.</p>

<p class='c021'>Breguet contrived a Clock to set a Watch to time. This
clock is of the size of a chamber-clock, and has a fork and
support on a top to carry the watch. When the clock strikes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>twelve, a piece of steel like a needle rises, and entering a
hole in the rim of the watch-case, comes in contact with a
piece which carries the minute-hand, and by pressure makes
the hand of the watch correspond with that of the clock,
provided the difference be not more than twenty minutes.</p>

<p class='c021'>The same artist constructed for George IV. a Chronometer
which had two pendulums, one making the machine
show mean time, the other to make it act as a metronome
by beating the time for music. This pendulum was merely
a small ball attached to a slight chain carried round a
pulley, on the centre of which was an index, which, when
brought to any of the musical measures engraved on the
scale, shortened or lengthened the chain, so as to cause the
pendulum to perform its oscillations in the time required,
and a hammer struck on a bell the beats contained in each
bar; these would be silently struck by placing a piece of
wood between the hammer and the bell; the musical time
was also indicated by the seconds-hand of the clock.</p>

<p class='c021'>A certain dynamical theory of chemistry has been propounded,
founded upon precipitations and decompositions
taking place in a definite space. Time forms, too, the very
key by which alone we can be admitted to a proper view of
the archives of the ancient world. Want of time for the due
development of the geological periods, for a long season,
hindered men’s conceptions upon this subject from taking
a sharp, clear cast of thought. Linnæus constructed a <i>Clock
of Flora</i>—a dial of flowers, each opening and shutting at an
appointed time.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c025'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>By a series of comparisons with Pendulums placed at
the surface and the interior of the earth, the Astronomer-Royal
has ascertained the variation of gravity in descending
to the bottom of a deep mine, as the Harton coal-pit, near
South Shields. By calculations from these experiments,
he has found the mean density of the earth to be 6·566, the
specific gravity of water being represented by unity. In
other words, it has been ascertained by these experiments
that if the earth’s mass possessed every where its average
density, it would weigh, bulk for bulk, 6·566 times as much
as water. The immediate result of the computations of the
Astronomer-Royal is: supposing a clock adjusted to go true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>time at the top of the mine, it would gain 2¼ seconds per
day at the bottom. Or it may be stated thus: that gravity
is greater at the bottom of a mine than at the top by
1/19190th part.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c025'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>The Electric Clock is an invention of our own time. An
ordinary clock consists essentially of a series of wheels
acting on each other, and carrying round, as they revolve,
the hands which mark the seconds, minutes, and hours.
The wheels are moved by the falling of a weight, or the unwinding
of a spring; and the rate at which they revolve is
determined by the length of a pendulum made to oscillate
by the wheels. In electric or (as they should rather be
called) electro-magnetic clocks, there are neither weights
nor springs; so that they never run down, and never require
to be wound up. To produce motion, electricity is employed
alternately to make and remake an electro-magnet,
or alternately to reverse the poles of a permanent magnet,
which, by lifting up and letting fall, or attracting and
repelling a lever, moves the wheels.</p>

<p class='c021'>M. Bouilly endeavoured to show that character was
much influenced by Time-keepers. He describes two young
persons who were allowed to select Watches for themselves:
one chose a plain watch, being told that its performance
could be depended on; the other, attracted by the elegance
of a case, decided upon one of inferior construction. The
possessor of the good Watch became remarkable for punctuality;
while the other, although always in a hurry, was
never in time, and discovered that, next to being too late,
there is nothing worse than being too early.</p>

<p class='c021'>The choice of a good Watch is, however, a difficult matter:
none but a good workman is capable of forming a
correct opinion; and a Watch must be bad indeed for an
inexperienced eye to detect the errors either of the principle
or its construction; even a trial of a year or two is
no proof, for wear seldom takes place within that time; and
while a good Watch can but go well, a bad one, by chance,
may occasionally do so.</p>

<p class='c021'>A Watch must not only be well constructed, and on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>good principle, but the brass must be hard, and the steel
properly tempered. The several parts must be in exact
proportion, and well finished, so as to continue in motion
with the least possible wear. It must also be so made that,
when taken to pieces, all its parts may be replaced as firmly
as before.</p>

<p class='c021'>A bad Watch is one in which no more attention has been
paid to the proportion of the parts, or durability of the
material, than was necessary to make it perform for a time:
it is either the production of inefficient workmen, or of
those who, being limited in price, are unable to give sufficient
time to perfect the work. In some instances these
Watches will go well for a time; but as they wear, from friction,
they require frequent repair, which cannot be effectually
done.</p>

<p class='c021'>The most useful lesson is, that low price is not exactly
another word for cheapness. If you wish to possess a good
Watch, apply to a maker of known honesty and ability in
the art he professes, and who, therefore, should be implicitly
trusted.</p>

<p class='c021'>It has been said, that “no man ever made a true circle,
or a straight line, except by chance;” and the same may be
said of any machine which measured time exactly; indeed,
positive accuracy can never be attained until an unchangeable
material is discovered, of which the works may be
constructed. These practical instructions are by Mr. Adam
Thomson.</p>

<p class='c021'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. There is an odd traditionary story told of a Watch at Somerset House. A
little above the entrance-door to the Stamps and Taxes is a white watch-face,—of
which it is told, that when the wall was being built, a workman had the misfortune
to fall from the scaffolding, and was only saved from destruction by the
ribbon of his watch, which caught in a piece of projecting work. In thankful
remembrance of his wonderful preservation, he is said to have inserted his
watch into the face of the wall. Such is the popular belief, and hundreds of
persons go to Somerset House to see this fancied memento, and hear the above
tale. But the watch-face was placed in its present position many years ago by
the Royal Society, as a meridian mark for a portable transit instrument in one
of the windows of the anteroom. Captain Smyth assisted in mounting the instrument,
and perfectly recollects the watch-face placed against the opposite
wall.</p>

<p class='c021'>“Up with the sun” implies, in common parlance, very
early habits, of difficult attainment. But, “we rise with
the sun at Christmas: it were but continuing to do so till
the middle of April, and without any perceptible change we
should find ourselves then rising at five o’clock; at which
hour we might continue till September, and then accommodate
ourselves again to the change of season, regulating
always the time of retiring in the same proportion. They
who require eight hours sleep would, upon such a system,
go to bed at nine during four months.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Thus wrote Southey, in his loved sojourn upon the Derwent,
of which he says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>In our great Public Schools, Early Rising appears to
have been practised from very remote periods. A manuscript
document, showing the system at Eton College about
the year 1560, records that the boys rose at five to the loud
call of “Surgite;” they repeated a prayer in alternate verses
as they dressed themselves, and then made their beds, and
each swept the part of the chamber close to his bed. They
then went in a row to wash, and then to the school, where
the under-master read prayers at six; then the præpositor
noted absentees, and one examined the students’ faces and
hands, and reported any boys that came unwashed.</p>

<p class='c021'>The great Lord Burghley, when at St. John’s College,
Cambridge, was distinguished by the regularity of his conduct,
and the intensity of his application: that he might
early devote several hours to study, without any hazard
of interruption, he was called up by the bell-ringer every
morning at four o’clock. Such was the educational basis upon
which Cecil laid the foundation of his brilliant but sound
reputation; and by which means, conjoined with the strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>natural gift of sagacity, and a mind tinctured with piety,
he acquired the esteem and confidence successively of three
sovereigns, and held the situation of prime minister of England
for upwards of half a century.</p>

<p class='c021'>Of Sir Edward Coke’s laborious course of study at the
Inner Temple, we have some interesting records. Every
morning at three, in the winter season lighting his own fire,
he read Bracton, Littleton, the Year Books, and the folio
Abridgments of the Law, till the courts met at eight. He
then went by water to Westminster, and heard cases argued
till twelve, when pleas ceased for dinner. After a short
repast in the Inner Temple Hall, he attended “readings”
or lectures in the afternoon, and then resumed his private
studies till five, or supper-time. This meal being ended,
the <i>moots</i> took place, when difficult questions of law were
proposed and discussed,—if the weather was fine, in the
garden by the river-side; if it rained, in the covered walks
near the Temple Church. Finally, he shut himself up in
his chamber, and worked at his common-place book, in
which he inserted, under the proper heads, all the legal
information he had collected during the day. When nine
o’clock struck, he retired to bed, that he might have an
equal portion of sleep before and after midnight.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c025'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Bishop Ken, when a scholar at William of Wykeham’s
College at Winchester, in the words of his fellow Wykehamist,
the Rev. W. Lisle Bowles, on the glimmering and cold
wintry mornings, would perhaps repeat to himself—watching
the slow morning through the grated window—one of
the beautiful ancient hymns composed for the scholars on
the foundation:</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Ken composed a devotional Manual for the use of the
Winchester scholars; but his most interesting compositions
are those affecting and beautiful hymns which were sung by
himself, and written to be sung in the chambers of the
boys, before chapel in the morning, and before they lay
down on their small boarded beds at night. Of Ken’s own
custom of singing his hymn to the Creator at the earliest
dawn, Hawkins, his biographer, relates, “that neither his
(Ken’s) study might be the aggressor on his hours of instruction,
nor what he judged duty prevent his improvement,
he strictly accustomed himself to but one hour’s
sleep, which obliged him to rise at one or two o’clock in
the morning, or sometimes earlier; and he seemed to go to
rest with no other purpose than the refreshing and enabling
him with more vigour and cheerfulness to sing his Morning
Hymn, as he used to do, to his lute, before he put on his
clothes.” When he composed those delicious hymns, he
was in the fresh morn of life; and who does not feel his
heart in unison with that delightful season, when such a
strain as this is heard?</p>

<p class='c021'>Ken died, Bishop of Bath and Wells, in 1711, in his 74th
year, and was carried to his grave, in Frome churchyard,

<p class='c021'>Rubens, the consummate painter, enlightened scholar,
skilful diplomatist, and accomplished man of the world,
was in the habit of rising very early,—in summer at four
o’clock; and he made it a law of his life to begin the day by
prayer. After this he went to work, and before his first
meal made those beautiful sketches known by the name of
<i>breakfast sketches</i>. While painting, he habitually employed
a person to read to him from one of the classical authors
(his favourites being Livy, Plutarch, Cicero, Seneca), or
from some eminent poet. This was the time when he generally
received his visitors, with whom he entered willingly
into conversation on a variety of topics in the most animated
and agreeable manner. An hour before dinner was always
devoted to recreation; which consisted either in allowing
his thoughts to dwell, as they listed, on subjects connected
with science or politics,—which latter interested him deeply,—or
in contemplating his treasures of art. As work was
his great happiness, he indulged but sparingly in the pleasures
of the table, and drank but little wine. After working
again till the evening, he usually mounted a spirited
Andalusian horse, and rode for an hour or two. On his
return home, he customarily received a few friends, principally
men of learning, or artists, to partake of a frugal
supper, and passed the evening in conversation. This
active and regular mode of life could alone have enabled
Rubens to satisfy all the demands which were made upon
him as an artist; for, including copies, the engravings from
works of Rubens amount to more than 1500; and the astonishing
number of his works, the genuineness of which is
beyond all doubt, can only be accounted for by his union of
extraordinary diligence with the acknowledged fertility of
his productive powers.</p>

<p class='c021'>John Wesley, at an early age, was sent to the Charter-house,
where he suffered under the tyranny which the elder
boys were permitted to exercise. The boys of the higher
forms were then in the practice of taking their portion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>meat from the younger ones, by the law of the strongest;
and during great part of the time that Wesley remained
there, a small daily portion of bread was his only food. He
strictly performed an injunction of his father’s, that he
should run round the Charter-house playing-green, of three
acres, three times every morning; and to this early practice
he attributed his great length of days.</p>

<p class='c021'>Wesley satisfied himself of the expediency of rising
early by experiment, which he describes thus:</p>

<p class='c028'>I waked every night about twelve or one, and lay awake for
some time. I readily concluded that this arose from my being longer
in bed than nature required. To be satisfied, I procured an alarum,
which waked me the next morning at seven (near an hour earlier than
I rose the day before), yet I lay awake again at night. The second
morning I rose at six; notwithstanding this I lay awake the second
night. The third morning I rose at five; nevertheless I lay awake
the third night. The fourth morning I rose at four, as I have done
ever since; and I lay awake no more. And I do not now lie awake,
taking the year round, a quarter of an hour together in a month. By
the same experiment, rising earlier and earlier every morning, may one
find out how much sleep he really wants.</p>

<p class='c023'>But Wesley’s moderation in sleep, and his rigid constancy
in rising early, admit of explanation. Mr. Bradburn, who
travelled with him almost constantly for years, said that
Wesley generally slept several hours in the course of the
day; that he had himself seen him sleep three hours together
often enough. This was chiefly in his carriage, in
which he accustomed himself to sleep on his journeys as
regularly, as easily, and as soundly, as if he had gone to bed.</p>

<p class='c021'>When at Oxford, he formed for himself a scheme of studies:
Mondays and Tuesdays were allotted for the Classics;
Wednesdays to logic and ethics; Thursdays to Hebrew and
Arabic; Fridays to metaphysics and natural philosophy;
Saturdays to oratory and poetry, but chiefly to composition
in those arts; and the Sabbath to divinity. It appears by
his diary, also, that he gave great attention to mathematics.
Full of business as he now was, he found time for writing
by rising an hour earlier in the morning, and going into
company an hour later in the evening: he had generally
from ten to twelve hours in the day which he could devote
to study: and thus he became alike familiar with the literature
of his day, as well as with that of past ages.</p>

<p class='c021'>Dr. Philip Doddridge attributes the production of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>various writings to his rising early; adding, “the difference
between rising at five and seven o’clock in the morning for
the space of forty years, supposing a man to go to bed at
the same hour at night, is nearly equivalent to the addition
of ten years to his life.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Through life, Gibbon the historian was a very early
riser. Before the first volume of his <i>Decline and Fall</i> had
given him celebrity, six o’clock was his usual hour of rising:
fashionable parties and the House of Commons brought
him down to eight.</p>

<p class='c021'>The day of the profound German philosopher, Immanuel
Kant, was begun early. Precisely at five minutes before
five o’clock, winter or summer, Lampe, Kant’s servant,
who had formerly served in the army, marched into his
master’s room with the air of a sentinel on duty, and cried
aloud in a military tone, “Mr. Professor, the time is come.”
This summons Kant invariably obeyed without one moment’s
delay, as a soldier does the word of command—never,
under any circumstances, allowing himself a respite, not
even under the rare accident of having passed a sleepless
night. As the clock struck five, Kant was seated at the
breakfast-table, where he drank what he called <i>one</i> cup of
tea, and no doubt he thought it such; but the fact was,
that, in part from his habit of reverie, and in part also for
the purpose of refreshing its warmth, he filled up his cup
so often, that in general he is supposed to have drunk two,
three, or some unknown number. Immediately after, he
smoked a pipe of tobacco; during which operation he
thought over his arrangements for the day, as he had done
the evening before during the twilight.</p>

<p class='c021'>Thomson, who has advocated early rising more eloquently
than any other writer, was himself an indolent man; he usually
lay in bed till noon, and his principal time for composition
was midnight. One of his early pictures is:</p>

<p class='c021'>Lord Chatham, writing to his nephew, January 12, 1754,
says: <i>Vitanda est improba Syren, Desidia</i>, I desire may be
affixed to the curtains of your bedchamber. If you do not
rise early, you can never make any progress worth mentioning.
If you do not set apart your hours of reading, if
you suffer yourself or any one else to break in upon them,
your days will slip through your hands unprofitably and
frivolously, unpraised by all you wish to please, and really
unenjoyed by yourself.</p>

<p class='c021'>Harford relates of Dr. Burgess, Bishop of Salisbury:</p>

<p class='c028'>Of his literary labours and self-denying life, writes a clergyman,
“few can have any conception. I was frequently admitted to see him
on business, even as early as six in the morning, when, rather than
detain me, he has seen me in his dressing-room. Often he kindly
remarked, ‘Your time is not your own, and is as precious to you as
mine; scruple not to send to me when you really want to see me.’ On
one of my early morning visits, about eight o’clock, in the winter, I
found him seated in his greatcoat and hat, writing at a table, in a room
without a carpet, the floor covered with old folios, and his candles only
just extinguished. ‘I have been writing and reading,’ he said, ’since
five o’clock.’ At another time I breakfasted with him one morning, by
appointment, at his hotel in town; and found him at eight o’clock,
about Christmas, writing by candlelight; the whole room being strewed
with old books, collected from various places in the metropolis. The
untiring perseverance with which he prosecuted his researches for evidence
on any particular subject is inconceivable.”</p>

<p class='c023'>Sir Astley Cooper, in one of his Lectures to his pupils,
used to say: “The means by which I preserve my own
health are: temperance, early rising, and sponging my body
every morning with cold water,—a practice I have pursued
for thirty years; and though I go from this heated theatre
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>into the squares of the Hospital in the severest winter-nights,
with merely silk stockings on my legs, yet I scarcely
ever have a cold. An old Scotch physician, for whom I had
a great respect, and whom I frequently met professionally
in the City, used to say, as we were entering the patient’s
room, ‘Weel, Mister Cooper, we ha’ only twa things to keep
in meend, and they’ll sarve us for here and herea’ter: one
is always to have the fear of the Laird before our ees, that
’ill do for herea’ter; and the t’other is to keep your booels
open, and that will do for here.’”</p>

<p class='c021'>William Cobbett, who had great contempt for conventionalities,
was an early riser from his boyhood,—when his
first occupation was driving the small birds from the turnip-seed
and the rooks from the peas; when he trudged with
his wooden bottle and his satchel, and was hardly able to
climb the gates and stiles; when he weeded wheat, and
had a single horse at harrowing barley; drove the team, or
held the plough—which employments he apostrophises as
“Honest pride, and happy days!” He tells us that to the
husbanding well of his time he owed his extraordinary promotion
in the army. He says: “I was always ready: if I
had to mount guard at ten, I was ready at nine; never did
any man or any thing wait one moment for me. Being at
an age under twenty years, raised from Corporal to Sergeant-Major
at once, over the heads of thirty Sergeants, I naturally
should have been an object of envy and hatred; but the
habit of early rising really subdued these passions; because
every one felt that what I did he had never done, and never
could do. Before my promotion, a clerk was wanted to
make out the morning report of the regiment. I rendered
the clerk unnecessary; and long before any other man was
dressed for the parade, my work for the morning was all
done, and I myself was on the parade, walking, in fine weather,
for an hour perhaps. My custom was this: to get up
in summer at daylight, and in winter at four o’clock; shave,
dress, and even to the putting of the sword-belt over my
shoulder, and having the sword lying on the table before
me, ready to hang by my side. Then I ate a bit of cheese,
or pork, and bread. Then I prepared my report, which was
filled up as fast as the companies brought me in the materials.
After this I had an hour or two to read, before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>time came for my duty out of doors, unless when the regiment,
or part of it, went out to exercise in the morning.
When this was the case, and the matter was left to me, I
always had it on the ground in such time as that the bayonets
glistened in the rising sun; a sight which gave me
delight, of which I often think, but which I should in vain
endeavour to describe. When I was commander, the men
had a long day of leisure before them: they could ramble
into the town or into the woods; go to get raspberries, to
catch birds, to catch fish, or to pursue any other recreation;
and such of them as chose and were qualified, to work at
their trades. So that here, arising solely from the early
habits of one very young man, were pleasant and happy
days given to hundreds.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Elsewhere Cobbett addresses this advice “to a lover:”
“Early rising is a mark of industry; and though, in the
higher situations of life, it may be of no importance in a mere
pecuniary point of view, it is, even there, of importance in
other respects: for it is, I should imagine, pretty difficult
to keep love alive towards a woman who never sees the
dew, never beholds the rising sun, and who constantly
comes directly from a reeking bed to the breakfast-table,
and there chews about without appetite the choicest morsels
of human food. A man might, perhaps, endure this for a
month or two without being disgusted; but that is ample
allowance of time. And as to people in the middle rank of
life, where a living and a provision for children is to be
sought by labour of some sort or other, late rising in the
wife is certain ruin; and never was there yet an early-rising
wife who had been a late-rising girl. If brought up to late
rising, she will like it; it will be her habit; she will, when
married, never want excuses for indulging in the habit: at
first she will be indulged without bounds; to make change
afterwards will be difficult; it will be deemed a wrong done
to her; she will ascribe it to diminished affection; a quarrel
must ensue, or the husband must submit to be ruined, or,
at the very least, to see half the fruit of his labour snored
and lounged away. And is this being rigid? is it being
harsh? is it being hard upon women? Is it the offspring
of the frigid severity of the age? It is none of these: it
arises from an ardent desire to promote the happiness, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>to add to the natural, legitimate, and salutary influence of
the female sex. The tendency of this advice is to promote
the preservation of their health; to prolong the duration of
their beauty; to cause them to be beloved to the last day
of their lives; and to give them, during the whole of their
lives, weight and consequence, of which laziness would render
them wholly unworthy.”</p>

<p class='c021'>When Cobbett had become a public writer, he constantly
inveighed against those who</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c033'>
    <div>O’er books consumed the midnight oil.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>In country or in town, at Barn Elms, in Bolt-court, or at
Kensington, he wrote his Registers early in the morning:
these, it must be admitted, had force enough; for he said
truly, “Though I never attempt to put forth that sort of
stuff which the intense people on the other side of the
Channel call <i>eloquence</i>, I bring out strings of very interesting
facts; I use pretty powerful arguments; and I hammer
them down so closely upon the mind, that they seldom fail
to produce a lasting impression.” This he owed, doubtless,
to his industry, early rising, and methodical habits.</p>

<p class='c021'>Daniel Webster, the famous American statesman, unlike
most men of his day, usually went to bed by nine o’clock,
and rose very early in the morning. General Lynian had
heard Webster say, that while in Washington, there were
periods when he shaved and dressed himself for six months
together by candlelight. The morning was his time for
study, writing, thinking, and all kinds of mental labour:
from the moment when the first streak of dawn was seen in
the east, till nine or ten o’clock in the forenoon, scarcely
a moment was lost; and it was then that his work was
principally done. Persons who occasionally called upon
him as early as ten in the morning, and found him ready
to converse with them, wondered when he did his work;
for they knew that he did work, yet they rarely, if ever,
found him, like other men of business, engaged. The truth
was, that when their day’s work began, his ended; and
while they were indulging in their morning dreams, Webster
was up, looking “quite through the deeds of men.”
This habit, followed from his youth, enabled him to make
those remarkable acquisitions of knowledge on all subjects,
and afforded him so much leisure to devote to his friends.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>The college-life of Albert, Prince Consort of Queen Victoria,
presents us with some of the beneficial results of the
habit of early rising. The people of England were not a
little surprised, at first, to hear that the Queen and the royal
Consort were seen walking together at a very early hour
on the morning of the very day after their marriage. But,
while at Bonn, Prince Albert was particularly distinguished
from the other students of the same rank for the salutary
habit of getting up early, one which he had uniformly persevered
in from his boyhood: therefore, it is very natural
that he should have adhered to it after he had come of age,
whether in England or in any other country, and be likely
to do so all the days of his life. At Bonn, the prince generally
rose about half-past five o’clock in the morning, and
never prolonged his repose after six. From that hour up
to seven in the evening, he assiduously devoted his whole
time to his studies, with the exception of an interval of
three hours, which he allowed himself for dinner and recreation.
At seven he usually went out, and paid visits to
those individuals or families who were honoured with his
acquaintance.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c025'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>To these instances of the remarkable labours which
have been accomplished by rising early, it can scarcely be
considered necessary to add any thing to enforce the benefits
to be derived from the practice. Nevertheless, something
has been said on the other side. An able essayist
has urged that most people who get up unusually early
find that there is nothing to do when they are dressed.
There are comparatively few mornings in the year when it
is pleasant to take an hour’s walk before breakfast in the
country. Then, if the early riser stays within doors, the
sitting-rooms are not ready for his reception. Among the
physical inconveniences, this writer shows that the early
riser, if not tormented with a consequent headache, is often
troubled with a feeling of sleepiness and heaviness through
the latter part of the day; and, as far as time goes, he is
apt to lose afterwards much more, while he in some way or
other compensates himself for his activity, than he gained
by the extra hour we are supposing him to have had early
in the morning. Then, the moral effect on the early riser,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>it is said, is to cause in him an exuberant feeling of conscious
goodness: he has performed a feat which raises
him, by his moral self-approval, above ordinary people, who
merely come down to breakfast. There is some truth in all
this, which, however, we think to be the exception rather
than the rule; for if early rising be the general practice in
a house, these minor inconveniences will soon disappear.
The above writer is inclined to allow that the objections to
early rising may too exclusively rest on exceptional cases.
He admits, with great fairness, in favour of the practice,
that “if the spare hour can be turned to serious profit, so
much the better. Coming at the beginning of the day, it
finds the mind tranquil, sanguine, and fresh. The time it
gives is likely to be free from interruptions; and the good
effect of the study will tell more powerfully than when it
has, as it were, the whole day in its grasp, than if it were
merely slipt in among the other thoughts and occupations
of busier hours. Health, too, is said to profit by early
rising; and so many people have stated this as a fact, that
it may perhaps be taken for granted.”<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c025'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c023'>The Aristotelian philosopher has well expressed its value

<p class='c021'>Fuller has this quaint instruction upon our present
topic: “Lay down such rules to thyself, of observing stated
hours for study and business, as no man shall be able to
persuade thee to recede from. For when thy resolutions
are once known, as no man of ingenuity will disturb thee,
so thou wilt find this method will become not only more
practicable, but of singular benefit in abundance of things.</p>

<p class='c021'>“He that loseth his morning studies, gives an ill precedent
to the afternoon, and makes such a hole in the beginning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>of the day, that all the winged hours will be in danger of
flying out thereat: think how much work is behind; how
slow thou hast wrought in thy time that is past; and what
a reckoning thou shouldst make, if thy Master should call
thee this day to thine account.</p>

<p class='c021'>“There is no man so miserable as he that is at a loss
how to spend his time. He is restless in his thoughts,
unsteady in his counsels, dissatisfied with the present, solicitous
for the future.</p>

<p class='c021'>“Be always employed; thou wilt never be better pleased
than when thou hast something to do. For business, by
its motion, brings heat and life to the spirits; but idleness
corrupts them like standing water.</p>

<p class='c021'>“Make use of time, if thou valuest eternity. Yesterday
cannot be recalled; to-morrow cannot be assured; to-day
only is thine, which if thou procrastinatest, thou losest;
which loss is lost for ever.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Dr. South, in one of his nervous Discourses, speaking of
the uncertainty of the present, says: “The sun shines in
his full brightness but the very moment before he passes
under a cloud. Who knows what a day, what an hour may
bring forth? He who builds upon the present, builds upon
the narrow compass of a point; and where the foundation is so
narrow, the superstructure cannot be high and strong too.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Sir William Jones, the profound scholar, of whom it was
said that if he were left naked and friendless on Salisbury-plain
he would nevertheless find the road to fame and riches,
left among his manuscripts the following lines on the management
of his time, which he had written in India, on a
small piece of paper:</p>

<p class='c021'>Dr. Johnson has moralised on Money and Time as “the
heaviest burdens of life;” adding, “the unhappiest of mortals
are those who have more of either than they know how
to use. To set himself free from these incumbrances, one
hurries to Newmarket; another travels over Europe; one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>pulls down his house, and calls architects about him; another
buys a seat in the country, and follows his hounds
over hedges and through rivers; one makes collections of
shells; and another searches the world for tulips and carnations.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Elsewhere Johnson has these pertinent remarks: “Among
those who have contributed to the advancement of learning,
many have risen to eminence in opposition to all the obstacles
which external circumstances could place in their
way,—amidst the tumults of business, the distresses of poverty,
or the dissipation of a wandering and unsettled state.
A great part of the life of Erasmus was one continued peregrination:
ill supplied with the gifts of fortune, and led
from city to city and from kingdom to kingdom by the
hopes of patrons and preferment, hopes which always flattered
and always deceived him, he yet found means, by
unshaken constancy and a vigilant improvement of those
hours which in the midst of the most restless activity will
remain unengaged, to write more than another in the same
condition could have hoped to read. Compelled by want
to attendance and solicitation, and so much versed in common
life that he has transmitted to us the most perfect
delineation of the manners of his age, he joined to his
knowledge of the world such application to books, that he
will stand for ever in the first rank of literary heroes. Now,
this proficiency he sufficiently discovers, by informing us
that the <i>Praise of Folly</i>, one of his most celebrated performances,
was composed by him on the road to Italy, lest
the hours which he was obliged to spend on horseback
should be tattled away, without regard to literature.”</p>

<p class='c021'>These are two memorable instances of the employment
of minute portions of time. We are told of Queen Elizabeth,
that, except when engaged by public or domestic affairs, and
the exercises necessary for the preservation of her health
and spirits, she was always employed in either reading or
writing, in translating from other authors, or in compositions
of her own; and that, notwithstanding she spent
much of her time in reading the best writings of her own
and former ages, yet she by no means neglected that best of
books, the Bible; for proof of which, take the Queen’s own
words: “I walk many times in the pleasant fields of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Holy Scriptures, where I pluck up the godlisome herbs
of sentences by pruning, eat them by reading, digest them
by musing, and lay them up at length in the high seat of
memory by gathering them together; that so, having tasted
their sweetness, I may the less perceive the bitterness of
life.” Her piety and great good sense were undeniable.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Chancellor of France, D’Aguesseau, finding that his
wife always kept him waiting a quarter of an hour after the
dinner-bell had rung, resolved to devote the time to writing
a book on jurisprudence; and putting the subject in execution,
in course of time produced a work in four quarto
volumes. His literary tastes greatly distinguished him from
the mass of mere lawyers.</p>

<p class='c021'>He whose mind the world wholly occupies imagines that
no time can be spared for divine duties. But many circumstances
in the lives of good men inform him that he is
mistaken. The wise statesman, the sound lawyer, the eminent
merchant, the skilful physician, the most profound
mathematician, astronomer, or general student, will rise up
in judgment against the man who endeavours to excuse the
observance of his religious duties under the plea of learned
or professional employment. Addison, Hale, Thornton,
Boerhaave, Bacon, Boyle, Newton, Locke, and many others,
prove that while the most important of worldly studies and
occupations employed their outward attention, <i>God rested at
their hearts</i>. The Ethiopian treasurer read Isaiah in his
chariot, and Isaac meditated in the fields. The friends of
the good Hooker, when they went to visit him at his parsonage,
found him with a book in his hand, tending his
own sheep. In short, the true Christian will neither want
place nor opportunity for devotion, nor for the cultivation
of those useful and general talents which may contribute to
the benefit or happiness of man.</p>

<p class='c021'>Lord Woodhouselee, in his <i>Life of Lord Kames</i>, has well
remarked, that the professional occupations of the best-employed
lawyer or the most distinguished judge cannot fill
up every interval of his time. The useful respite of vacation,
the hours of sickness, the surcease of employment
from the infirmities of age,—all necessarily induce seasons
of languor, against which a wise man would do well to provide
a store in reserve, and an antidote and cordial to cheer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>and support his spirits. In this light the pursuits of science
and literature afford an unbounded field and endless variety
of useful occupations; and even in the latest hours of life
the reflection on the time thus spent, and the anticipation
of an honourable memorial in after ages, are sources of consolation
of which every ingenuous mind must fully feel the
value. How melancholy was the reflection uttered on his
deathbed by one of the ablest lawyers and judges of the
last age, but whose mental stores were wholly limited to
the ideas connected with his profession, “<i>My life has been
a chaos of nothing!</i>”</p>

<p class='c021'>Sir Matthew Hale, one of the most upright judges that
ever sat upon the English bench, was of a benevolent and
devout, as well as righteous disposition; and in addition to
his great legal works, found time to write several volumes
on natural philosophy and divinity. His <i>Contemplations
Moral and Divine</i>, written two centuries since, retain their popularity
to this day. Bishop Burnet, his biographer, tells us
that “his whole life was nothing else but a continual course
of labour and industry; and when he could borrow any
time from the public service, it was wholly employed either
in philosophical or divine meditation.” ... “He that considers
the active part of his life, and with what unwearied
diligence and application of mind he despatched all men’s
business that came under his care, will wonder how he
could find time for contemplation; he that considers, again,
the various studies he passed through, and the many collections
and observations he made, may as justly wonder
how he could find any time for action. But no man can
wonder at the exemplary piety and innocence of such a life
so spent as this was, wherein, as he was careful to avoid
every evil word, so it is manifest <i>he never spent an idle day</i>.”</p>

<p class='c021'>At every turn we are defeated through want of due regard
to this preciousness of time. “In early life we lay
long plans of conduct. After a considerable interval, we
find most of our plans unexecuted; we then begin to reflect
that if they <i>are</i> to be accomplished, a far smaller portion
of our time than we had originally allotted to them can
be employed in their execution, and, what is perhaps more
fatal to our schemes, that portion is uncertain. An awful
thought for those who have in their possession many of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>the chief blessings of life, and are approaching, by a rapid
progress, that mortal bourn from whence no traveller returns.”<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c025'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>How much of our time would be saved by the cultivation
of the habit of being content to be ignorant of certain
subjects! Nothing can be more beneficial to the mind than
this habit; since it has thereby a more free and open access
to matters of the highest importance.</p>

<p class='c021'>How much of our time is wasted in paying visits of
insincerity! Boileau being one day visited by an indolent
person of rank, who reproached him with not having returned
his former call; “You and I,” replied the satirist,
“are upon unequal terms: I lose my time when I pay you
a visit; you only get rid of yours when you pay me one.”</p>

<p class='c021'>One of the most familiar methods of taking note of time
is by what are usually termed family parties. When these
are given on public holidays, the effect is doubtless beneficial.
Southey has well remarked: “Festivals, when duly
observed, attach men to the civil and religious institutions
of their country: it is an evil, therefore, when they fall into
disuse.” They do more,—in reminding us of the fewer
anniversaries we have to witness.</p>

<p class='c021'>Boyle has these wholesome reflections upon <i>profuse
talkers</i>: he tells us “that easiness of admitting all Kind of
Company, provided men have boldness enough to intrude
into ours, is one of the uneasiest Hardships (not to say
Martyrdoms) to which Custom has expos’d us, and does
really do more Mischief than most Men take notice of;
since it does not only keep impertinent Fools in countenance,
but encourages them to be very troublesome to
Wise Men. The World is pester’d with a certain sort of
Praters, who make up in Loudness what their Discourses
want in Sense; and because Men are so easie natur’d as
to allow the hearing to their Impertinencies, they presently
presume that the things they speak are none; and most
Men are so little able to discern in Discourse betwixt Confidence
and Wit, that to any that will but talk loud enough
they will be sure to afford answers. And (which is worse)
this readiness to hazard our Patience, and certainly lose
our Time, and thereby incourage others to multiply idle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>words, of which the Scripture seems to speak threateningly,
is made by Custom an Expression, if not a Duty, of Civility;
and so even a Virtue is made accessory to a Fault.</p>

<p class='c021'>“For my part, though I think these Talkative people
worse publick Grievances than many of those for whose
prevention or redress Parliaments are wont to be assembled
and Laws to be enacted; and though I think their Robbing
us of our time a much worse Mischief than those petty Thefts
for which Judges condemn Men, as a little Money is a less
valuable good than that precious Time, which no sum of it
can either purchase or redeem; yet I confess I think that
our great Lords and Ladies, that can admit this sort of
Company, deserve it: For if such Persons have but minds
in any measure suited to their Qualities, they may safely,
by their Discountenance, banish such pitiful Creatures, and
secure their Quiet, not only without injuring the Reputation
of their Civility, but by advancing that of their Judgment.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Sir John Harrington, the epigrammatic poet in the
reign of Elizabeth, and a dangler at her court, appears, by
the following confession, from his <i>Breefe Notes and Remembrances</i>,
to have been a disappointed man: “I have spente
my time, my fortune, and almost my honestie, to buy false
hope, false friends, and shallow praise;—and be it remembered,
that he who casteth up this reckoning of a courtlie
minnion, will sette his summe like a foole at the ende, for
not being a knave at the beginninge. Oh, that I could
boaste, with chaunter David, <i>In te speravi Domine!</i>”</p>

<p class='c021'>Many ill-regulated persons thoughtlessly waste their own
time simultaneously with that of others. Lord Sandwich,
when he presided at the Board of Admiralty, paid no attention
to any memorial that extended beyond a single page.
“If any man,” he said, “will draw up his case, and will put
his name to the bottom of the first page, I will give him an
immediate reply: where he compels me to turn over the
page, he must wait my pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c021'>George III., though always willing and ready for business,
disliked (as who does not?) long speeches out of
season; and grievously lamented the well-informed but
verbose and ill-timed eloquence of his minister, Grenville.
“When,” such were the King’s own words to Lord Bute,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“he has wearied me for two hours, he looks at his watch
to see if he may not tire me for one hour more.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Paley had an ingenious mode of economising his time,
and keeping off these time-wasters. The Earl of Ellenborough
is in possession of the only original portrait of the
Doctor, which was painted for the earl’s father by Romney.
Paley was painted with the fishing-rod, by his own particular
desire; not because he cared much about fishing,
but because while he was so occupied he could keep intruders
at a distance, and give his mind to uninterrupted
thought. He kept people away, not because they disturbed
the fish, but because they disturbed him. <i>He composed his
works while he seemed to fish.</i><a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c025'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Sterne, in one of his fascinating Letters, writes: “Time
wastes too fast: every letter I trace tells me with what
rapidity life follows my pen: the days and hours of it more
precious, my dear Jenny, than the rubies about thy neck,
are flying over our heads like light clouds of a windy day,
never to return more. Every thing presses on; whilst thou
art twisting that lock,—see, it grows gray; and every time
I kiss thy hand to bid adieu, and every absence which follows
it, are preludes to that eternal separation which we are
shortly to make.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Thomson’s habit of composition while he lay in bed has
been mentioned. We knew a reverend vicar who usually
composed his sermon in bed, and committed it to paper
next morning. Dr. Wallis, who nearly two centuries ago
was professor of geometry at Oxford, attained the power of
making arithmetical calculations “without the assistance
of pen and ink, or aught equivalent thereunto,” to such an
extent, that he extracted the square root of three down to
twenty places of decimals. We must indeed suppose him
to have had originally some peculiar aptitude for such calculations;
but he describes himself to have acquired it by
practising at night and in the dark, when there was nothing
to be seen, and nothing to be heard, that would disturb his
attention. It is in such uninterrupted intervals that we best
learn to think; and Sir Benjamin Brodie<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c025'><sup>[26]</sup></a> acknowledges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>that in these ways he had not unfrequently derived ample
compensation for the wearisome hours of a sleepless night.</p>

<p class='c021'>Division of time is the grand secret of successful industry.
Lockhart, in his <i>Life of Scott</i>, shows how effectually
the illustrious subject of his memoir found opportunity for
unequalled literary labour, even while enjoying all the amusements
of a man of leisure. “Sir Walter rose by five o’clock,
lit his own fire when the season required one, and shaved
and dressed with great deliberation; for,” says his biographer,
“he was a very martinet as to all but the mere coxcombries
of the toilet, not abhorring effeminate dandyism
itself so cordially as the slightest approach to personal slovenliness,
or even those ‘bed-gown and slipper tricks,’ as
he called them, in which literary men are so apt to indulge.
Arrayed in his shooting-jacket, or whatever dress he meant
to use till dinner-time, he was seated at his desk by six
o’clock, all his papers arranged before him in the most accurate
order, and his books of reference marshalled around
him on the floor, while at least one favourite dog lay watching
his eye just beyond the line of circumvallation. Thus,
by the time the family assembled for breakfast, between
nine and ten, he had done enough (in his own language)
‘to break the neck of the day’s work.’ After breakfast a
couple of hours more were given to his solitary tasks, and by
noon he was, as he used to say, ‘his own man.’ When the
weather was bad, he would labour incessantly all the morning;
but the general rule was to be out and on horseback
by one o’clock at the latest; while, if any more distant excursion
had been proposed overnight, he was ready to start
on it by ten; his occasional rainy days of unintermitted
study forming, as he said, a fund in his favour, out of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>he was entitled to draw for accommodation whenever the
sun shone with special brightness.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Sir Walter Scott, writing to a friend who had obtained a
situation, gave him this excellent practical advice: “You
must be aware of stumbling over a propensity, which easily
besets you from the habit of not having your time fully
employed; I mean what the women very expressively call
<i>dawdling</i>. Your motto must be <i>Hoc age</i>. Do instantly whatever
is to be done, and take the hours of recreation after
business, and never before it. When a regiment is under
march, the rear is often thrown into confusion because the
front does not move steadily and without interruption. It
is the same thing with business. If that which is first in
hand is not instantly, steadily, and readily despatched, other
things accumulate behind, till affairs begin to press all at
once, and no human brain can stand the confusion. Pray
mind this: this is a habit of mind which is very apt to beset
men of intellect and talent, especially when their time is
not regularly filled up, and left at their own arrangement.
But it is like the ivy round the oak, and ends by limiting,
if it does not destroy, the power of manly and necessary
exertion. I must love a man so well, to whom I offer such
a word of advice, that I will not apologise for it, but expect
to hear you are become as regular as a Dutch clock,—hours,
quarters, minutes, all marked and appropriated. This is a
great cast in life, and must be played with all skill and
caution.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Coleridge observes: “It would, indeed, be superfluous
to attempt a proof of the importance of Method in the business
and economy of active or domestic life. From the
cotter’s hearth, or the workshop of the artisan, to the palace
or the arsenal, the first merit, that which admits neither
substitute nor equivalent, is, that <i>every thing is in its place</i>.
Where this charm is wanting, every other merit loses its
name, or becomes an additional ground of accusation and
regret. Of one by whom it is eminently possessed, we say
proverbially, he is like clockwork. The resemblance extends
beyond the point of regularity, and yet falls short of
the truth. Both do, indeed, at once divide and announce
the silent and otherwise undistinguishable lapse of time.
But the man of methodical industry and honourable pursuits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>does more: he realises its ideal divisions, and gives
a character and individuality to its moments. If the idle
are described as killing time, he may be justly said to call it
into life and moral being, while he makes it the distinct
object not only of the consciousness, but of the conscience.
He organises the hours, and gives them a soul; and that
the very essence of which is to fleet away, and ever more <i>to
have been</i>, he takes up into his own permanence, and communicates
to it the imperishableness of a spiritual nature.
Of the good and faithful servant, whose energies, thus directed,
are thus methodised, it is less truly affirmed, that
he lives in time, and that time lives in him. His days,
months, and years, as the stops and punctual marks in the
records of duties performed, will survive the wreck of
worlds, and remain extant when time itself shall be no
more.”<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c025'><sup>[27]</sup></a> This is admirable reasoning.</p>

<p class='c021'>A great deal has been said against routine and red tape,
or rather the abuse of the latter; but its proper use has
much to do with success. Curran, when Master of the
Rolls, once said to Grattan, “You would be the greatest
man of your age, Grattan, if you would buy a few yards of
red tape, and tie up your bills and papers;” though another
version of the anecdote has, “<i>tie up your thoughts</i>.” This
was the fault and misfortune of Sir James Mackintosh: he
never knew the use of red tape, and was utterly unfit for
the common business of life. That a guinea represented a
quantity of shillings, and that it would barter for a quantity
of cloth, he was well aware; but the accurate number
of the baser coin, or the just measurement of the manufactured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>articles to which he was entitled for his gold, he
could never learn, and it was impossible to teach him.
Hence his life was often an example of the ancient and
melancholy struggle of genius with the difficulties of existence.</p>

<p class='c021'>The tying-up thoughts corresponds with Fuller’s aphorism,
“Marshall thy thoughts into a handsome method.
One will carry twice more weight trussed and perched up in
bundles, than when it lies untoward, flapping and hanging
about his shoulders. Things orderly fardled up under heads
are most portable.” This is the plan adopted by lawyers
upon their tables. The Duke of Wellington had a table
upon which his papers were thus arranged; and, during
his absence for any length of time, a sort of lid was placed
upon the table and locked, so as to secure the papers without
disturbing their arrangement.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Duke of Wellington is also known to have been
an early riser; the advantages of which were illustrated
throughout his long life. His service of the Sovereigns
and the public of this country for more than half a century,—in
diplomatic situations and in councils, as well as
in the army,—has scarcely a parallel in British history.
His Despatches are the best evidence of his well-regulated
mind in education. No letters could ever be more temperately
or more perspicuously expressed than those famous
documents. They show what immense results in the aggregate
were obtained by the Duke, solely in virtue of habits
which he had sedulously cultivated from his boyhood—early
rising, strict attention to details, taking nothing ascertainable
for granted, unflagging industry, and silence,
except when speech was necessary, or certainly harmless.
His early habit of punctuality is pleasingly illustrated in
the following anecdote: “I will take care to be punctual at
five to-morrow morning,” said the engineer of New London
Bridge, in acceptance of the Duke’s request that he would
meet him at that hour the following morning. “Say a
quarter before five,” replied the Duke, with a quiet smile;
“I owe all I have achieved to being ready a quarter of an
hour before it was deemed necessary to be so; and I learned
that lesson when a boy.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Whoever has seen “the Duke’s bedroom” at Apsley-house,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>and its plain appointments, will not regard it as a
chamber of indolence. It was, a few years since, narrow,
shapeless, and ill-lighted; the bedstead small, provided only
with a mattress and bolster, and scantily curtained with
green silk; the only ornaments of the walls were an unfinished
sketch, two cheap prints of military men, and a
small portrait in oil: yet here slept the Great Duke, whose
“eightieth year was by.” In the grounds and shrubbery
he took daily walking exercise, where with the garden-engine
he was wont to enjoy exertion; reminding one of General
Bonaparte at St. Helena, “amusing himself with the
pipe of the fire-engine, spouting water on the trees and
flowers in his favourite garden.”</p>

of the fine range of the Betchworth Hills, in Surrey. In the <i>Inquiries</i> are some
interesting traces of the work having been written in the tranquillity of Broome,
and its picturesque characteristics of noble cedars, elms, and chestnuts, stream
and sheet of water, and mineral spring. In the opening pages, “the fresh air
and quiet of his residence in the country” evidently refers to Broome; and
throughout the volume are occasional references to the geniality of the place
for the group of philosophers who keep up the mode of dialogue. Sir Benjamin
Brodie was some time President of the Royal Society; and it may be worthy of
notice, that his two volumes of “Inquiries,” in their thoughtful tone and reflective
colour, bear some resemblance to the two volumes produced in the
retirement of his illustrious predecessor in the Chair of the Royal Society—Sir
Humphry Davy; but with this difference,—that Sir Benjamin Brodie’s Researches
are of more practical application than the speculative Dialogues of our
great chemical philosopher, Davy.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c021'><a href='#r27'>27</a>. Coleridge, however, was a better preacher than practitioner of what he so
urgently recommends. When in his younger days he was offered a share in the
<i>London Journal</i>, by which he could have made two thousand pounds a year,
provided he would devote his time seriously to the interest of the work, he
declined,—making the reply, so often praised for its disinterestedness, “I will
not give up the country, and the lazy reading of old folios, for two thousand
times two thousand pounds; in short, beyond three hundred and fifty pounds
a year, I consider money a real evil.” The “lazy reading of old folios” led
to laziness, the indolent gratification of mind and sense. Degenerating into
an opium-eater, and a mere purposeless theoriser, Coleridge wasted time,
talents, and health; came to depend, in old age, on the charity of others; and
died at last, with every one regretting, even his friends, that he had done
nothing worthy of his genius. The world is full of men having Coleridge’s
faults, without Coleridge’s abilities; men who cannot, or will not, see beyond
the present; who are too lazy to work for more than a temporary subsistence,
and who squander, in pleasure or idleness, energy and health, which ought to
lay up a capital for old age.</p>

<p class='c023'>Sir Thomas More, when a youth, painted for his father’s
house in London a hanging with nine pageants, with verses
over each. There were Childhood, Manhood, Venus and
Cupid, Age, Death, and Fame. In the sixth pageant was
painted the image of Time, and under his feet was lying
the picture of Fame that was in the sixth pageant. And
over this seventh pageant was (spelling modernised):</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LIFE—A RIVER.</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Pliny</span> has compared a River to Human Life; and Sir Humphry
Davy was a hundred times struck with the analogy,
particularly among mountain scenery. A full and clear
River is the most poetical object in nature; and contemplating
this, Davy wrote: “The river, small and clear in its
origin, gushes forth from rocks, falls into deep glens, and
wantons and meanders through a wild and picturesque
country, nourishing only the uncultivated tree or flower by
its dew or spray. In this, its state of infancy and youth, it
may be compared to the human mind, in which fancy and
strength of imagination are predominant; it is more beautiful
than useful. When the different rills or torrents join,
and descend into the plain, it becomes slow and stately in
its motions; it is applied to move machinery, to irrigate
meadows, and to bear upon its bosom the stately barge;—in
this mature state, it is deep, strong, and useful. As it
flows on towards the sea, it loses its force and its motion;
and at last, as it were, becomes lost and mingled with the
mighty abyss of waters.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Again, Life is often compared to a River, because one
year follows another, and vanishes like the ripples on its
surface.  A flood, without ebb, bears us onward; “we can
never cast anchor in the river of life,” as Bernardin de St.
Pierre finely and profoundly observes.</p>

<p class='c021'>But the comparison can be still further developed. “It
is taking a false idea of life,” says Cuvier, “to consider it as
a single link, which binds the elements of the living body
together, since, on the contrary, it is a power which moves
and sustains them unceasingly. These elements,” he adds,
“do not for an instant preserve the same relations and connexions;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>or, in other words, the living body does not for an
instant keep the same state and composition.”</p>

<p class='c021'>But this is only the new enunciation of a very old idea
in science. Long before Cuvier, Leibnitz said, “Our body
is in a perpetual flux, like a river; particles enter and leave
it continually.” And long before Leibnitz, physiologists had
compared the human body to the famous ship of Theseus,
which was always the same ship, although, from having been
so often repaired, it had not a single piece with which it was
originally constructed. The truth is, that the idea of the
continued renovation of our organs<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c025'><sup>[28]</sup></a> has always existed in
science; but it is also true that it has always been disputed.</p>

<p class='c021'>M. Flourens has proved by direct experiment that the
mechanism of the development of the bones consists essentially
in a continual irritation of all the parts composing
them. But it is the change of <i>material</i>; for its <i>form</i> changes
very little. Cuvier has further developed this fine idea:</p>

<p class='c028'>In living bodies no molecule remains in its place; all enter and
leave it successively: life is a continued whirlpool, the direction of
which, complicated as it is, remains always constant, as well as the
species of molecules which are drawn into it, but not the individual
molecules themselves; on the contrary, the actual material of the living
body will soon be no longer in it; and yet it is the depository of the
force which will constrain the future material in the same direction as
itself. So that the form of these bodies is more essential to them than
the material, since this latter changes unceasingly, while the other is
maintained.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE SPRING-TIME OF LIFE.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The Spring-time of Life,—the meeting-point of the child
and the man,—the brief interval which separates restraint
from liberty,—has a warmth of life, which Dr. Temple thus
pictures with glowing eloquence. “To almost all men this
period is a bright spot to which the memory ever afterwards
loves to recur; and even those who can remember nothing
but folly,—folly, of which they have repented, and relinquished,—yet
find a nameless charm in recalling such folly
as that. For indeed even folly at that age is sometimes the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>cup out of which men quaff the richest blessings of our
nature,—simplicity, generosity, affection. This is the seed-time
of the soul’s harvest, and contains the promise of the
year. It is the time for love and marriage, the time for
forming life-long friendships. The after-life may be more
contented, but can rarely be so glad and joyous. Two
things we need to crown its blessings,—one is, that the
friends whom we then learn to love, and the opinions which
we then learn to cherish, may stand the test of time, and
deserve the esteem and approval of calmer thoughts and
wider experience; the other, that our hearts may have
depth enough to drink largely of that which God is holding
to our lips, and never again to lose the fire and spirit of the
draught. There is nothing more beautiful than a manhood
surrounded by the friends, upholding the principles, and
filled with the energy of the spring-time of life. But even
if these highest blessings be denied, if we have been compelled
to change opinions and to give up friends, and the
cold experience of the world has extinguished the heat of
youth, still the heart will instinctively recur to that happy
time, to explain to itself what is meant by love and what by
happiness.”<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c025'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE FIRST TWENTY YEARS OF LIFE.</h3>

<p class='c023'>It is a saying of Southey’s, “that, live as long as you
may, the first twenty years are the longest half of your life.
They appear so while they are passing; they seem to have
been so when we look back to them; and they take up more
room in our memory than all the years that succeed them.”</p>

<p class='c021'>But in how strong a light has this been placed by the
American teacher, Jacob Abbott, whose writings have obtained
so wide a circulation in England. “Life,” he says,
“if you understand by it the season of preparation for eternity,
is more than half gone; life, so far as it presents opportunities
and facilities for penitence and pardon,—so far
as it bears on the formation of character, and is to be considered
as a period of probation,—is unquestionably more
than half gone to those who are between fifteen and twenty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>In a vast number of cases it is more than half gone even
<i>in duration</i>; and if we consider the thousand influences
which crowd around the years of childhood and youth, winning
us to religion, and making a surrender of ourselves to
Jehovah easy and pleasant,—and, on the other hand, look
forward beyond the years of maturity, and see these influences
losing all their power, and the heart becoming
harder and harder under the deadening effects of continuance
in sin,—we shall not doubt a moment that the years of
immaturity make a far more important part of our time of
probation than all those that follow.”</p>

<p class='c021'>That pious man, who, while he lived, was the Honourable
Charles How, and might properly now be called the
honoured, says, that “twenty years might be deducted for
education from the threescore and ten, which are the allotted
sum of human life; this portion,” he adds, “is a time
of discipline and restraint, and young people are never easy
till they are got over it.”</p>

<p class='c021'>There is indeed during those years much of restraint, of
weariness, of hope, and of impatience; all which feelings
lengthen the apparent duration of time. Sufferings are not
included here; but with a large portion of the human race,
in all Christian countries (to our shame be it spoken), it
makes a large item in the account; there is no other stage
of life in which so much gratuitous suffering is endured,—so
much that might have been spared,—so much that is a
mere wanton, wicked addition to the sum of human misery,
arising solely and directly from want of feeling in others,
their obduracy, their caprice, their stupidity, their malignity,
their cupidity, and their cruelty.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c025'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c023'>“The deaths of some, and the marriages of others,”
says Cowper, “make a new world of it every thirty years.
Within that space of time the majority are displaced, and a
new generation has succeeded. Here and there one is permitted
to stay longer, that there may not be wanting a few
grave dons like myself to make the observation.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Yet, infinitely short as the term of human life is when
compared with time to come, it is not so in relation to time
past. A hundred and forty of our own generations carry us
back to the Deluge, and nine more of antediluvian measure
to the Creation,—which to us is the beginning of time;
“for time itself is but a novelty, a late and upstart thing
in respect of the ancient of days.”<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c025'><sup>[31]</sup></a> They who remember
their grandfather, and see their grandchildren, have seen
persons belonging to five out of that number; and he who
attains the age of threescore, has seen two generations
pass away. “The created world,” says Sir Thomas Browne,
“is but a small parenthesis in eternity, and a short interposition,
for a time, between such a state of duration as
was before it, and may be after it.” There is no time of
life, after we become capable of reflection, in which the
world to come must not to any considerate mind appear of
more importance to us than this; no time in which we
have not a greater stake there. When we reach the threshold
of old age, all objects of our early affections have gone
before us, and in the common course of mortality a great
proportion of the later. Not without reason did the wise
compilers of our admirable Liturgy place next in order after
the form of Matrimony, the services for the Visitation and
Communion of the Sick, and for the Burial of the Dead.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c025'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>A home-tourist, halting in the quiet churchyard of Mortlake,

reflective train of calculation of generations:</p>

<p class='c021'>“I reflected that, as it is now more than four hundred
years since this ground became the depository of the dead,
some of its earliest occupants might, without an hyperbole,

nation. If we suppose that a man was buried in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>churchyard 420 years ago, who left six children, each of
whom had three children, who again had, on an average,
the same number in every generation of thirty years; then,
in 420 years, or fourteen generations, his descendants might
be multiplied as under:</p>

<h3 class='c012'>AVERAGE DURATION OF LIFE.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The Assurance of Lives has often been regarded, by
weak-minded persons, as an interference with the ways of
Providence, which is highly reprehensible. But it can be
shown that calculation of lives can be averaged with certainty.
Mr. Babbage, in his work on the Assurance of
Lives, observes: “Nothing is more proverbially uncertain
than the duration of human life, where the maxim is applied
to an individual; yet there are few things less subject to
fluctuation than the average duration of a multitude of individuals.
The number of deaths happening amongst persons
of our own acquaintance is frequently very different in
different years; and it is not an uncommon event that this
number shall be double, treble, or even many times larger
in one year than in the next succeeding. If we consider larger
societies of individuals, as the inhabitants of a village or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>small town, the number of deaths is more uniform; and
in still larger bodies, as among the inhabitants of a kingdom,
the uniformity is such, that the excess of deaths in
any year above the average number seldom exceeds a small
fractional part of the whole. In the two periods, each of fifteen
years, beginning at 1780, the number of deaths occurring
in England and Wales in any year did not fall short of,
or exceed, the average number one-thirteenth part of the
whole; nor did the number dying in any year differ from
the number of those dying in the next by a tenth part.”</p>

<p class='c021'>In a paper on Life Assurance, in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, the
Average Mortality of Europe is thus stated: “In England
1 person dies annually in every 45; in France, 1 in every 42;
in Prussia, 1 in every 38; in Austria, 1 in every 33; in Russia,
1 in every 28. Thus England exhibits the lowest mortality;
and the state of the public health is so improved,
that the present duration of existence may be regarded (in
contrast to what it was a hundred years ago) as, in round
numbers, <i>four to three</i>.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The Registrar-General gives the following statistical results:
“The average age of life is 33⅓ years. One-fourth of
the born die before they reach the age of seven years, and
the half before the seventeenth year. Out of 100 persons,
only six reach the age of 60 years and upwards, while only
1 in 1000 reaches the age of 100 years. Out of 500, only 1
attains 80 years. Out of the thousand million living persons,
330,000,000 die annually, 91,000 daily, 3730 every hour,
60 every minute, consequently 1 every second. The loss is,
however, balanced by the gain in new births. Tall men are
supposed to live longer than short ones. Women are generally
stronger than men until their fiftieth year, afterwards
less so. Marriages are in proportion to single life (bachelors
and spinsters) as 100:75. Both births and deaths are more
frequent in the night than in the day.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PASTIMES OF CHILDHOOD RECREATIVE TO MAN.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Paley regarded the pleasure which the amusements of
childhood afford as a striking instance of the beneficence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>of the Deity. We have several instances of great men descending
from the more austere pursuits to these simple
but innocent pastimes. The Persian ambassadors found
Agesilaus, the Lacedæmonian monarch, riding on a stick.
The ambassadors found Henry the Fourth playing on the
carpet with his children; and it is said that Domitian, after
he had possessed himself of the Roman empire, amused
himself by catching flies. Socrates, if tradition speaks truly,
was partial to the recreation of riding on a wooden horse;
for which, as Valerius Maximus tells us, his pupil Alcibiades
laughed at him. (Is not this the origin of our rocking-horse?)

<p class='c024'>as Horace says, invent the children’s rattle? Toys have
served to unbend the wise, to occupy the idle, to exercise
the sedentary, and to instruct the ignorant. To come to
our own times: we have heard of a Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland,
a man of grave years and thoughts, being surprised
playing at leap-frog with his young nephews.</p>

<p class='c021'>The same desire to unstring the bow, as old Æsop taught,
impels sturdy workmen, let loose from their toil, to seek diversion
in the amusements of boyhood. Often have we seen
scores of men break forth from a factory or printing-office
for their dinner-hour, and in great measure disport themselves
like schoolboys in a playground.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PLEASURES OF THE IMAGINATION LATE IN LIFE.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Dugald Stewart, in his <i>Essay on the Cultivation of Intellectual
Habits</i>, predicates, in persons of mature age, what
may be termed the enjoyment of a second season of enjoyments
far more refined than the first. Thus he says:
“Instances have frequently occurred of individuals in whom
the power of imagination has, at an advanced period of life,
been found susceptible of culture to a wonderful degree.
In such men, what an accession is gained to their most refined
pleasures! What enchantments are added to their
most ordinary perceptions! The mind, awakening, as if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>from a trance, to a new existence, becomes habituated to
the most interesting aspects of life and of nature; the intellectual
eye is ‘purged of its film;’ and things the most
familiar and unnoticed disclose charms invisible before.
The same objects and events which were lately beheld
with indifference occupy now all the powers and capacities
of the soul, the contrast between the present and the past
serving only to enhance and to endear so unlooked-for an
acquisition. What Gray has so finely said of <i>the pleasures
of vicissitude</i> conveys but a faint image of what is experienced
by the man who, after having lost in vulgar occupations
and vulgar amusements his earliest and most
precious years, is thus introduced at last to a new heaven
and a new earth:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The meanest floweret of the vale,</div>
      <div class='line'>The simplest note that swells the gale,</div>
      <div class='line'>The common sun, the air, the skies,</div>
      <div class='line'>To him are op’ning Paradise.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Nothing can be more deplorable than a man who has
outlived the likings, and perchance the innocence, of his
early life; which is by no means rare, if they have not
grown out of the study and love of nature, for this clings
to the heart in all the vicissitudes of life,—in adversity as
well as in prosperity; in sickness as well as in health; even
to extreme old age, when almost every other worldly source
of pleasure is dried up. Hear the testimony of Hannah
More, at the age of eighty-two: “The only one of my
youthful fond attachments,” says she, “which exists still
in full force, is a passion for scenery, raising flowers, and
landscape gardening.” Well indeed will it be for the young
if they follow the example of this venerable woman, and
early acquire a passion for scenery and flowers. For as
they pass through life, they will find the world often frowning
upon them, but the flowers will always smile. And it
is sweet, in the day of adversity, to be met with a smile.</p>

<p class='c021'>We remember a touching instance of the love of flowers
lighting up the last hours of a botanist who had wooed nature
in the picturesque vale of Mickleham, in Surrey. A
few short hours before his death, he turned to his niece and
said: “Mary, it is a fine morning; go and see if <i>Scilla verna</i>
is come in flower.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>WHAT IS MEMORY?</h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Man possesses a nervous system pervaded by a nervous
force, the modification of which manifests itself to our consciousness
in the varied phenomena of what we call Sensation.
From Sensation, the next step is to Perception. Sensation,
we know, as such, dies away from the consciousness,
or rather is obliterated by fresh impressions upon the sensorium.
We cannot retain a feeling in perpetuity. But when
a definite sensation has been excited, or a distinct experience
has been acquired, something remains behind; and
upon these <i>residua</i>, left in the structure of the nerves, or the
cerebral tissues, or the animating soul, and on the permanence
of these <i>residua</i>, rests the whole possibility of reminiscence.
Upon this blending and organisation round the centre
of mind-life follows the faculty of Memory, or that power
which the mind possesses of making a peculiar representation
of an object for itself, of creating a special idea of it
by giving greater prominence to some features, and letting
others sink away unthought of, till there remains an image,
the product of its own free activity, which it can mentally
connect with other trains of ideas, and thus multiply, as it
were, the bridges by which it can return to it at any period.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c025'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Byron has beautifully personified this paramount image:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>She was a form of life and light,</div>
      <div class='line'>That seen became a part of sight;</div>
      <div class='line'>And rose, where’er I turned mine eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Morning-star of Memory!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Mere abstraction, or what is called absence of mind,
is often attributed, very unphilosophically, to a want of
memory. La Fontaine, in a dreaming mood, forgot his
own child, and, after warmly commending him, observed
how proud he should be to have such a son. In this kind
of abstraction external things are either only dimly seen,
or are utterly overlooked; but the memory is not necessarily
asleep. In fact, its too intense activity is frequently
the cause of the abstraction. This faculty is usually the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>strongest when the other faculties are in their prime, and
fades in old age, when there is a general decay of mind and
body. Old men, indeed, are proverbially narrative; and
from this circumstance it sometimes appears as if the memory
preserves a certain portion of its early acquisitions
to the last, though in the general failure of the intellect it
loses its active energy. It receives no new impressions,
but old ones are confirmed. The brain seems to grow
harder. Old images become fixtures. It is recorded of
Pascal, that, till the decay of his health had impaired his
memory, he forgot nothing of what he had done, read, or
thought in any part of his rational age. The Admirable
Crichton could repeat backwards any speech he had made.
Magliabecchi, the Florentine librarian, could recollect whole
volumes; and once supplied an author from memory with a
copy of his own work, of which the original was lost. Pope
has observed that Bolingbroke had so great a memory, that
if he was alone and without books he could refer to a particular
subject in them, and write as fully on it as another
man would with all his books about him. Woodfall’s extraordinary
power of reporting the debates in the House of
Commons without the aid of written memoranda is well
known. During a debate he used to close his eyes and
lean with both hands upon his stick, resolutely excluding
all extraneous associations. The accuracy and precision of
his reports brought his newspaper into great repute. He
would retain a full recollection of a particular debate a fortnight
after it had occurred, and during the intervention of
other debates. He used to say that it was put by in a corner
of his mind for future reference.”<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c025'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>CONSOLATION IN GROWING OLD.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Montaigne said of Cicero <i>On Old Age</i>, “It gives one an
appetite for old age.” Its persuasive eloquence is the inspiration
of an elevated philosophy. Flourens has cleverly
said, “The moral aspect of old age is its best side. We cannot
grow old without losing our <i>physique</i>, nor also without
our <i>morale</i> gaining by it. This is a noble compensation.”</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>M. Reveillé-Parise says: “In a green old age, when from
fifty-five to seventy-five years, and sometimes more, the life
of the mind has a scope, a consistence, and remarkable solidity,
man having then truly attained to the height of his
faculties.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Patience is the privilege of age. A great advantage to
the man who has lived is, that he knows how to wait. Again,
experience is an old man’s memory.</p>

<p class='c021'>Buffon was seventy years of age (this was young for
Buffon, he lived to eighty-one) when he wrote <i>The Epochs of
Nature</i>, in which he calls old age a prejudice. Without our
arithmetic we should not, according to Buffon, know that
we were old. “Animals,” he says, “do not know it; it is
only by our arithmetic that we judge otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c028'>Buffon having settled on his estate at Montbard, in Burgundy, there
pursued his studies with such regularity that the history of one day
seems to have been that of all the others through a period of fifty years.
After he was dressed, he dictated letters, and regulated his domestic
affairs; and at six o’clock he retired to his studies in a pavilion in his
garden, about a furlong from the house. This pavilion was only furnished
with a large wooden secretary and an arm-chair; and within it
was another cabinet, ornamented with drawings of birds and beasts.
Prince Henry of Prussia called it the cradle of natural history; and
Rousseau, before he entered it, used to fall on his knees, and kiss the
threshold. Here Buffon composed the greater number of his works.
At nine o’clock he usually took an hour’s rest; and his breakfast, a piece
of bread and two glasses of wine, was brought to him. When he had
written two hours after breakfast, he returned to the house. At dinner
he enjoyed the gaieties and trifles of the table. After dinner he slept
an hour in his room; took a solitary walk; and during the rest of the
evening he either conversed with his family or guests, or examined his
papers at his desk. At nine o’clock he went to bed, to prepare himself
for the same routine of judgment and pleasure. He had a most fervid
imagination; and his anxious solicitude for a literary immortality,
“that last infirmity of noble minds,” continually betrayed him to be a
vain man.</p>

<p class='c023'>“Every day that I rise in good health,” said Buffon to
a conceited young man, “have I not the enjoyment of this
day as fully as you? If I conform my actions, my appetites,
my desires, to the strict impulses of wise nature, am I not
as wise and happy as you are? And the view of the past,
which causes so much regret to old fools, does it not afford
me, on the contrary, the pleasures of memory, agreeable pictures
of precious images, which are equal to your objects
of pleasure? For these images are sweet; they are pure;
they leave upon the mind only pleasing remembrances; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>uneasiness, the disappointments, the sorrowful troop which
accompanies your youthful pleasures, disappear from the
picture which presents them to me. Regrets must disappear
also; they are the last sparks of that foolish vanity that
never grows old.</p>

<p class='c021'>“Some one asked Fontenelle, when ninety-five years old,
which were the twenty years of his life he most regretted.
He replied that he had little to regret; but the age at which
he had been most happy was that from forty-five to seventy-five.
He made this avowal in sincerity, and he proved what
he said by natural and consoling truths. At forty-five, fortune
is established; reputation made; consideration obtained;
the condition of life established; dreams vanished or fulfilled;
projects miscarried or matured; most of the passions
calmed, or at least cooled; the career in the work that every
man owes to society nearly completed; enemies, or rather
the enemies, are fewer, because the counterpoise of merit is
known by the public voice,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c021'>Galen, speaking of Hippocrates, and wishing to represent
in one word the man who, in his eyes, constitutes the most
perfect type of slowly matured wisdom and profound experience,
simply calls him <i>the old man</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'>The first rule of the Art of Preserving Life is to know how
to be old. “Few men know how to be old,” said La Rochefoucauld.
Voltaire has—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Qui n’a pas l’esprit de son âge,</div>
      <div class='line'>De son âge a tous les malheurs.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The first rule is more philosophic than medical, but is
perhaps none the less valuable.</p>

<p class='c021'>The second rule is to know yourself well; which is also
a philosophical precept applied to medicine.</p>

<p class='c021'>The third rule is properly to conform to regular habits.
Old men, who spend one day like another, with the same moderation,
the same appetites, live always. “My miracle is existence,”
said Voltaire; and if that foolish vanity which never
grows old had not induced him, when eighty-four years of
age, to make a ridiculous journey to Paris, his miracle would
have continued a century, as was the case with Fontenelle.</p>

<p class='c021'>“Few would believe,” said M. Reveillé-Parise, “how far a
little health, well managed, may be made to go.” And Cicero
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>said: “To use what we have, and to act in every thing according
to our strength,—such is the rule of the sage.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Most men die of disease, very few die of mere age. Man
has made for himself a sort of artificial life, in which the
moral is often worse than the physical; and the physical
itself often worse than it would be with habits more serene
and calm, more regularly and judiciously exercised.</p>

<p class='c021'>Haller, the physiologist, says: “Man should be placed
among the animals that live the longest: how very unjust,
then, are our complaints of the brevity of life!” He then
inquires what can be the extreme limit of the life of man;
and he gives it as his opinion that man might live not less
than two centuries. M. Flourens,<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c025'><sup>[36]</sup></a> however, decides on a
century of ordinary life; and at least half a century of extraordinary
life is the prospect science holds out to man. Still,
as these inferences are drawn from the exceptions of Jenkins
and Parr, the opinions must be received accordingly.</p>

<p class='c021'>Haller, who has collected a great number of examples of
Longevity, says that he has found more than</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LENGTH OF DAYS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>There are few records so generally interesting as those of
human existence being protracted beyond “threescore years
and ten,” and the Psalmist’s limit of “fourscore years.” It
is natural to expect every man, woman, and child to take a
kindred interest in such matters: the girl or boy reads with
wonder the dates upon the tombstones of very aged persons;
and old men and women approach these memorials with awe,
in proportion to their fancied distance from the same earthly
bourn. All cannot alike read the story of the pictured urn,
or the mysteries of the inverted torch or the winged mundus;
but the uneducated young and old are sensible of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>solemnity of the line, “Aged 102 years;” whilst the more
pretentious “Hic jacet” only teaches the comparatively few
that</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The paths of glory lead but to the grave.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>We are not, therefore, surprised at the implicit belief in
such records in times gone by, when no populous village in
England was without a man or woman of fourscore years
old. It has, however, become of late a matter of some
moment to inquire into the authority on which statements
of extreme old age have usually rested; and the result has
been to shake the testimony of many recorded cases of great
longevity.</p>

<p class='c021'>Lord Bacon, in his <i>History of Life and Death</i>, quotes as a
fact unquestioned, that a few years before he wrote, a morris-dance
was performed in Herefordshire, at the May-games,
by eight men, whose ages in the aggregate amounted to
eight hundred years! In the seventeenth century, some
time after Bacon wrote, two Englishmen are reported to
have died at ages greater than almost any of those which
have been attained in other nations. According to statements
which are printed in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> of
the Royal Society, as well as his epitaph in Westminster
Abbey, Thomas Parr lived 152 years and 9 months; Henry
Jenkins, 169 years. The testimony in these extraordinary
instances is, however, considered by the Registrar-General
by no means conclusive, as it evidently rests on uncertain
tradition, and on the very fallible memories of illiterate old
men; for there is no mention of documentary evidence in
Parr’s case, and the births date back to a period (1538) before
the parish registers were instituted by Cromwell.</p>

<p class='c021'>Yet parish registers are sometimes astounding; for in
that of Evercreech, in Somersetshire, occurs this entry:
“1588, 20th Dec., Jane Britton, of Evercriche, a Maidden,
as she afirmed, of the age of 200 years, was buried.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Here is a difficulty of belief cleared up. In the register
of the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, is entered, among
the “Burialles, Thomas Cam, y<sup>e</sup> 22d inst. of January 1588 (curiously
enough the date of the Somersetshire entry), Aged
207 years, Holywell-street. George Garrow, parish clerk.”
In a newspaper paragraph of 1848, this entry is stated to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>add: “he was born in the year 1381, in the reign of King
Richard II., and lived in the reigns of twelve kings and
queens.” These words are not, however, in the register;
and it is evident that some mischievous person has altered
the figure 1 into 2. Sir Henry Ellis, in his <i>History of Shoreditch</i>,
gives the entry correctly as follows: “Thomas Cam,
aged 107, 28 January 1588.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Another instance, less known, but better authenticated,
is that of Sir Ralph Vernon, of Shipbrooke, who was born
some time in the thirteenth century, died at the great age
of 150; and is said to have been succeeded by his descendant
in the sixth generation; he was called “Old Sir Ralph,”
or Sir R. “the long-liver.” A deed of settlement by him
was the cause of long litigation; and it is said that the
papers respecting this law-suit still exist, to prove the fact of
the old knight’s patriarchal age.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c025'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>In Conway churchyard is the tombstone of Lowry Owens,
stated to have died “May the 1st, 1766, aged 192;” but the
inscription has evidently been recut, and, it is presumed,
with a difference, especially as the round of the “9” is above
the date-line.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the church of Abbey Dore, Herefordshire, is a slab to
the memory of Elizabeth Lewis, who died “aged 141 years,”
which is stated to be confirmed by the parish register.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the churchyard of Cheve Prior, Worcestershire, is a
record of a man who died at the age of 309; doubtless meant
for 39, the blundering stonecutter having put the 30 first
and 9 afterwards.</p>

<p class='c021'>In these and similar cases our belief should be in proportion
to the trustworthiness of the record, allowance being
made for the imperfect state of documents of times when
writing was a comparatively rare accomplishment. It is
curious to contrast this state of things with the chronicle of
our times, when, occasionally, one day’s newspaper records
several instances of longevity:</p>

<p class='c028'>In the <i>Morning Post</i>, January 30th, 1858, out of thirty-five deaths
recorded, with the ages, there were five upwards of 60 and under 70;
70 and under 80, seven; in 80th year and upwards, nine; one female,
95; and Mrs. E. Miles, of Bishop Lidyard, near Taunton, 112.</p>

<p class='c041'>In the obituary of the <i>Times</i>, February 20th, 1862, were recorded
the deaths of persons who had attained the following ages: one of 103,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>one of 94, two of 90, one of 85, one of 84, one of 82, and eight of 70
years and upwards. And, on April 20th of the same year, were recorded
the deaths of ten persons, whose united ages amount to 828 years, or
an average of nearly 83. They comprise one of 100 and one of 99.</p>

<p class='c023'>Of late years considerable interest has been added to the
attraction of records of Longevity, by showing through how
few individuals may be traced the evidence of far-distant
events and incidents in our history.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Sidney Gibson, F.S.A., relates some curious instances
of this class. A person living in 1847, then aged about 61,
was frequently assured by his father that, in 1786, he repeatedly
saw one Peter Garden, who died in that year at the
age of 127 years; and who, when a boy, heard Henry Jenkins
give evidence in a court of justice at York, to the effect
that, when a boy, he was employed in carrying arrows up the
hill before the battle of Flodden Field.</p>

<p class='c024'>So that a person living in 1786 conversed with a man that
fought at Flodden Field.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Gibson then passes on to some remarkable instances
of longevity from the Scrope and Grosvenor Roll, the record
of the celebrated cause in the reign of Richard II., when,
among the noble and knightly deponents who gave evidence
in the following year, 1386, were:</p>

<p class='c021'>Sir John Sully, Knight of the Garter and a distinguished
soldier of the cross, who had served for eighty years, was
then, by his own account, 105 years of age, and who is supposed
to have died in his 108th year.</p>

<p class='c021'>But, more remarkable, John Thirlwall, an esquire of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>ancient Northumbrian house, deposes to what he heard
from his father, who died forty-four years before, at the
age of 145.</p>

<p class='c021'>Not far from Thirlwall Castle, at Irthington, Mr. B. Gibson
has seen the register of the burial of Robert Bowman,
one of the most remarkable of the long-lived yeomen of that
parish, who died in the year 1823, at the age of 118.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. John Bruce, F.S.A., has also illustrated our subject
by the following curious evidence. Lettice, Countess of Leicester,
was born in 1539 or ’40, and was consequently 7 years
old at the death of Henry VIII. She may very well have
had a recollection of the bluff monarch, who cut off the head
of her great-aunt, Anne Boleyn. She was thrice married,
and had seen six English sovereigns, or seven if Philip be
counted; her faculties were unimpaired at 85; and until a
year or two of her death, on Christmas-day 1634, at the age
of 94, she “could yet walk a mile of a morning.” Lettice was
one of a long-lived race: her father lived till 1596; two of her
brothers attained the ages of 86 and 99.</p>

<p class='c021'>There is nothing (says Mr. Bruce) incredible, or even
very extraordinary, in Lettice’s age; but even her years will
produce curious results if applied to the subject of possible
transmission of knowledge through few links. I will give
one example: “Dr. Johnson, who was born in 1709, might
have known a person who had seen the Countess Lettice.
If there are not now (1857), there were amongst us within
the last three or four years, persons who knew Dr. Johnson.
There might, therefore, be only two links between ourselves
and the Countess Lettice, who saw Henry VIII.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c025'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. John Pavin Philips writes from Haverfordwest: “A
friend of mine, now (1857) in his 80th year, knew an old
woman resident in his parish who remembered her grandmother,
who saw Cromwell when he was in Pembrokeshire,
in 1648. I myself, when a student in Edinburgh in 1837,
knew a centenarian lady, named Butler, who well recollected
being taken by her mother to witness the public entry of
Prince Charles Edward into the city in 1745.” And in Haverfordwest
might be seen daily walking, in 1857, in perfect
health, a man who was born four years previous to the death
of George II.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c025'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Mary Yates, of Shiffnal, Salop, who died 1776, aged 128,
well remembered walking to view the ruins of the Great Fire
of London, 1666.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the <i>News Letter</i> of June 1st, 1724, Bodl. Mss., Rawl.
C., it is related, that on the King’s birthday, as the nobility
and others of distinction passed through Pall Mall to Court
at St. James’s, there sat in the street one Elinor Stuart,
being 124 years old. She had kept a linen-shop at Kendal,
and had nine children living at the time King Charles I.
was beheaded, and was undone by adhering to the royal
cause. “She is reckoned,” says the account (Jane Skrimshaw,
who was now dead, being 128), “the oldest woman in
London.”<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c025'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Margaret Mapps, of Eaton, near Leominster, who died in
1800, aged 109, had so retentive a memory, that to her last
hours she could relate many incidents which she had witnessed
in the reign of Queen Anne.</p>

<p class='c021'>In 1858 died Mrs. Milward, of Blackheath, at the age of
102. She was, consequently, born four years previous to
the accession of George III.; she saw the separation of
the American colonies from the mother country; the three
French revolutions, and the great war with France; she well
remembered the London riots of 1780, and was placed in
some jeopardy in Hyde-park in one of the incidents.</p>

<p class='c021'>Jane Forrester, of Cumberland, is stated in the <i>Public
Advertiser</i>, March 9th, 1766, as then living in her 138th year:
she remembered Cromwell’s siege of Carlisle, in 1646; and
in 1762 she gave evidence in a Chancery-suit of an estate
having been enjoyed by the ancestors of the then heir 101
years.</p>

<p class='c021'>One Evans, of Spitalfields, who died 1780, is stated to
have reached the age of 139 years: he remembered the execution
of Charles I., at which time he was 7 years old.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the London newspapers of November 7th, 1788, is
recorded the celebration of the centenary of the Revolution,
at which was present a person who remembered that glorious
event; he was 112 years old, and belonged to the French
Hospital, Old Street-road, where were then ten persons whose
ages together were 1000 years.</p>

<p class='c021'>In 1826 there died at Corby, near Carlisle, aged 102, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Joseph Liddle, a shoemaker, who was at work in his shop, in
the market-place of Carlisle, when the Scotch rebels entered
the town, in 1745; he was very fond of horticulture, and, with
little help, kept in order a large garden nearly until the day
of his death.</p>

<p class='c021'>Samuel Rogers, the banker-poet, who died on December
18th, 1855, aged 96, among many accomplishments possessed
a most retentive memory; and his sweep of recollections
was very wide.</p>

<p class='c028'>He remembered when one of the Rebels’ heads remained on Temple
Bar; when schoolboys chased butterflies in the fields in cocked hats;
when gentlemen universally wore wigs and swords; when Ranelagh was
in all its glory, and ladies going thither had head-dresses so preposterously
high that they had to sit on stools placed in the bottom of the
coach; when Garrick crowded the theatre, Reynolds crowded the lecture-room,
and Johnson crowded the club; he had heard the Duke of
York relate how he and his brother George, when young men, were
robbed by footpads on Hay-hill, Berkeley-street; he had shaken hands
with John Wilkes, dined with Lafayette, Condorcet, &amp;c. at Paris, before
the great Revolution began, and been present at Warren Hastings’ trial
in Westminster Hall; he had seen Lady Hamilton go through her “attitudes”
before the Prince of Wales, and Lord Nelson spin a teetotum
with his <i>one</i> hand for the amusement of children.—<i>R. Carruthers.</i></p>

<p class='c041'>Mr. Peter Cunningham noted, a few days after the death of our
Poet: “When Rogers made his appearance as a poet, Lord Byron was
unborn—and Byron has been dead thirty-one years! When Percy
Bysshe Shelley was born, Rogers was in his 30th year—and Shelley has
been dead nearly thirty-four years! When Keats was born, <i>The Pleasures
of Memory</i> was looked upon as a standard poem—and Keats has
been dead thirty-five years! When this century commenced, the man
who died but yesterday, and in the latter half too of the century, had
already numbered as many years as Burns and Byron had numbered
when they died. Mr. Rogers was born before the following English
poets: Scott, Southey, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Moore, Campbell,
Bloomfield, Cunningham, Hogg, James Montgomery, Shelley,
Keats, Wilson, Tom Hood, Kirk White, Lamb, Joanna Baillie, Felicia
Hemans, L. E. L.; and he outlived them all.”</p>

<p class='c023'>On April 24th, 1858, died Mr. James Nolan, at Auchindrane,
Carlow, Ireland, aged 115 years and 9 months. There
is something more interesting than his being the oldest subject
of her Majesty, who had lived in the reigns of five sovereigns
of England; and no doubt it is curious to be carried
back by two lives—Mr. Nolan and his father—to the reign
of Charles II., and almost to the time of Cromwell.</p>

<p class='c021'>Here is a remarkable instance: Commander Pickernell,
R.N., who died April 20th, 1859, aged 87, knew well in his
youth a man who was a soldier encamped on Hounslowheath
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>at the time of the Revolution in 1688. This same
man played an instrument in the band at Queen Anne’s
coronation, and served through Marlborough’s wars; in his
old age he returned to the neighbourhood of his native
place, Whitby, where he died, considerably over a century,
when Commander Pickernell was a boy about 7 or 8 years
old.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c025'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>The venerable President of Magdalen College, Oxford,
Dr. Routh, who died 1855, in his hundredth year, brought
up old memories of times and men long passed away. Dr.
Routh had known Dr. Theophilus Lee, the contemporary of
Addison; had seen Dr. Johnson “in his brown wig scrambling
up the steps of University College;” and had been told
by a lady of her aunt who had been present when Charles
II. walked round the parks at Oxford.</p>

<p class='c021'>Dr. Routh had maintained an immediate and personal
connexion with the University of Oxford for upwards of 80
years; and his long life supplied many instructive links
between the present and the past. He was born in the
reign of King George II., before the beginning of the Seven
Years’ War; before India was conquered by Clive, or Canada
by Wolfe; before the United States ever dreamt of independence;
and before Pitt had impressed the greatness of
his own character on the policy of Britain. The life of this
college student comprehended three most important periods
in the history of the world. Martin Routh saw the last
years of the old state of society which introduced the political
deluge; he saw the deluge itself—the great French
Revolution, with all its catastrophes of thrones and opinions;
and he lived to see the more stirring but not less striking
changes which forty years of peace had engendered. It
is therefore not a little curious to read of such a man,
that the times on which his thoughts chiefly dwelt were
those of the Stuarts; which is not, however, altogether surprising,
as he might himself have shaken hands with the
Pretender. This Prince did not die till young Routh was
ten years of age; so that, if accident had put the chance in
his way, he might easily have had an interview with the
representative of James II.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c025'><sup>[42]</sup></a> What an interval was there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>between this epoch and Dr. Routh sitting for a photograph
on his hundredth birthday!</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LONGEVITY IN FAMILIES.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The long life of different members of the same family is
remarkable. In 1836, Mrs. H. P., residing near the Edgeware-road,
attained her 103d year: she had three sisters,—one
107, another 105; and the other, who died about 1834,
100.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Bailey records the death of Widow Stephenson, of
Wolverton, Durham, in 1816, aged 104: her mother lived to
be 106, two sisters 106 and 107, and a brother 97; making
an aggregate of 519 years as the age of these five relatives.</p>

<p class='c021'>Edward Simon, 81 years a dock-labourer in Liverpool,
died 1821, aged 101: his mother lived to 103; his father 101;
and a brother 104.</p>

<p class='c021'>Gilbert Wakefield states that his wife’s great-grandfather
and great-grandmother’s matrimonial connexion lasted seventy-five
years: they died nearly at the same time, she at
the age of 98, he at the age of 108. He was out hunting a
short time before his death. His portrait is in the hall of
Mr. Legh, of Lyme.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mary Tench, of Cromlin, Ireland, who died 1790, aged
100, was of aged parents; her father attained 104, and her
mother 96; her uncle reached 110 and she left two sisters,
whose aggregate ages made 170.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the year 1811, within four miles of the house at Alderbury
formerly occupied by Parr, there died, in the month
of September, four persons, whose ages were 97, 80, 96, and
97. There were then living in the neighbourhood a man
aged 100, and two others of 90.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Costello family, county Kilkenny, lived to very great
ages. On June 12, 1824, died Mary Costello, aged 102; her
mother died at precisely the same age; her grandmother at
120; her great-grandmother exceeded 125: long before her
death, she had to be rocked in a cradle, like an infant. Mary
Costello’s brother lived beyond 100 years; and when 90, cut
down half an acre of grass in a day.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c025'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>In Appleby churchyard is a tombstone in memory of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>three persons named Hall: the grandfather died in 1716,
aged 109, and the father aged 86; and the son died in 1821,
aged 106. “So that the father had seen a man (his father)
who saw James I., and also a man (his son) who saw me, or
might have done so.”<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c025'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>The Countess of Mornington, who died in 1831, attained
the age of 90: her eldest son, the Marquis Wellesley, ennobled
for his administration in India, reached 82; his brother,
Lord Maryborough, 83; Lady Maryborough, 91; and
their brother, the Great Duke of Wellington, 83. We possess
a small portrait of Lady Mary Irvine, aunt to Lady Maryborough,
painted in her 82d year; the face is without a
wrinkle, but of <i>riant</i> beauty.</p>

<p class='c021'>The London bankers, Joseph and William Joseph Denison,
exceeded 80; and the sister of the latter, Dowager
Marchioness of Conyngham, 90.</p>

<p class='c021'>Lady Blakiston, died, November 1862, in her 102d year;
and her eldest son, Sir Matthew Blakiston, died December
following, in his 82d year.</p>

<p class='c021'>“On 8th April 1860, Mr. S. Cronesberry died at Farmer’s

<h3 class='c012'>FEMALE LONGEVITY.</h3>

<p class='c023'>One of the most celebrated personages in the history of
Female Longevity is the Countess of Desmond, who is usually
said to have died early in the 17th century, aged 140 years.
Bacon, in his <i>Natural History</i>, describes her as “the old
Countess of Desmond, who lived till she was sevenscore
years old, that she did <i>dentire</i> (produce teeth) twice or
thrice.” Sir Walter Raleigh, in his <i>History of the World</i>,
says: “I myself <i>knew</i> the old Countess of Desmond of
Inchiquin, in Munster, who lived in the year 1589, and
many years since, who was married in Edward IV.’s time,
and held her jointure from all the Earls of Desmond since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>then: and that this is true, all the noblemen and gentlemen
in Munster can witness.”<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c025'><sup>[46]</sup></a> Sir William Temple was
told by Robert Earl of Leicester of the Countess married
in Edward IV.’s time, “and who lived far in King
James’s reign, and was counted to have died some years
above 140.” There has been much controversy respecting
the portraits of this lady which are said to exist: that in
the possession of the Knight of Kerry, and engraved in
1806, is reputed authentic; and after much discussion, the
Countess has been identified as Katharine, second wife of
Thomas 12th Earl of Desmond, who died in 1534. Fynes
Morrison, the traveller, who was in Ireland from 1599 to
1603, tells of the Countess living to the age of about 140
years; of her walking four or five miles weekly to the market-town
in her last years; and of her death by falling out
of a tree which she had climbed to gather nuts. There is
a tradition which might be true, of her having danced at
Court with the Duke of Gloucester (Richard III.), of whom
she affirmed that he was the handsomest man in the room,
except his brother Edward, and was very well made.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c025'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Of Margaret Patten, stated to have died 136 and 138
years old, a curious portrait was found at Glasgow, amongst
some family papers, in 1853. She was born in the parish
of Locknugh, near Paisley, in Scotland, and is described
beneath the portrait as “now living in the workhouse of
St. Margaret’s, Westminster, aged 138.” And in the Boardroom
of St. Margaret’s workhouse is another portrait of
Margaret (there stated to be 136), the gift of the overseers
of the parish in 1737. The old woman was buried in the
burial-ground of the Broadway church, now Christ-church,
Westminster, where a stone is inscribed, “Near this place
lieth Margaret Patten, who died June 26, 1739, in the Parish
Workhouse, aged 136.” “She was brought to England to
prepare Scotch broth for King James II.; but owing to the
abdication of that monarch, fell into poverty, and died in St.
Margaret’s workhouse. Her body was followed to the grave
by the parochial authorities and many of the principal inhabitants,
while the children sung a hymn before it reached
its last resting-place.”<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c025'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>In the Dublin Exhibition of 1853 was a print with this
inscription: “Mary Gore, born at Cottonwith in Yorkshire,
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1582; lived upwards of one hundred years in Ireland,
and died in Dublin, aged 145 years. This print was done
from a picture <i>taken</i> (the word is torn off) when she was one

<p class='c021'>The following instances of long widowhoods are interesting:
the widow of Thomas, second Lord Lyttleton, who died
in 1779, survived his lordship in a state of widowhood sixty-one
years, dying in 1840, aged 97.</p>

<p class='c021'>The widow of David Garrick died in 1822, in the same
house, on the Adelphi-terrace, wherein her celebrated husband
died forty-three years previously. We remember a
small etching of the old lady appearing in the print-shops
just after her death, portraying her characteristic dignified
deportment. Among the legacies bequeathed to her husband’s
family was a service of pewter used by him when a
bachelor, and having the name of Garrick engraven on it.</p>

<p class='c021'>The widow of Charles James Fox, the statesman, died in
1842, aged 96, having survived her husband thirty-six years.</p>

<p class='c021'>Amelia Opie, the amiable novelist, died in 1853, in her
85th year, having survived her husband, the painter, forty-six
years. He painted a remarkable picture of Mrs. Opie,—two
portraits, full-face and profile, upon the same canvas; they
are said to be faithful likenesses.</p>

<p class='c021'>Some years since, writes the editor of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>,
“we beheld the strange sight of an old woman, aged
102, bent double, crooning over the fire, and nursing in her
lap an infant a few days old. The infant was the grandchild
of the old woman’s grandchild. The only remarkable circumstance
in the veteran’s history was, that she had nursed
Wordsworth in his infancy. She had lived the greater part
of her life in Westmoreland, near the poet’s residence, and
there her descendants had been chiefly born and lived.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Here are a few instances of women of remarkable talent
attaining great ages:</p>

<p class='c021'>Caroline Lucretia Herschel, who discovered seven comets,
and passed years of nights as amanuensis to her brother, Sir
William Herschel, in his astronomical labours, attained the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>age of 97, with her intellect clear, and princes and philosophers
alike striving to do her honour.</p>

<p class='c021'>Miss Linwood, whose Needlework Pictures were exhibited
nearly sixty years, died in 1844, at the age of 90. No needlework
of ancient or modern times has ever surpassed these
productions. The collection consisted of sixty-four pictures,
mostly of large or gallery size; the finest work, from the
“Salvator Mundi,” by Carlo Dolci, was bequeathed by Miss
Linwood to Queen Victoria; for this picture 3000 guineas
had been refused.</p>

<p class='c021'>Dr. Webster, F.R.S., who takes great interest in records
of Longevity, in 1860 contributed to the <i>Athenæum</i> a copy of
the certificate of birth of a lady in her 100th year, living at
Hampstead, namely, the surviving sister of the authoress
Miss Joanna Baillie, who died 1851, aged 89. This document
is as follows:</p>

<p class='c028'>Copy of an entry in a separate register of the Presbytery of Hamilton,
under the head “Shotts.”—That Mr. James Baillie had a daughter
named Agnes, born 24th September 1760, attested and signed at Hamilton
the 25th day of November 1760, in presence of the Presbytery.—Signed,
James Baillie; John Kirk, Clerk; Patrick Maxwell, Moderator.</p>

<p class='c023'>In the same year, 1859, died Lady Morgan, the novelist,
at 76; Leigh Hunt, the poet and <i>littérateur</i>, at 75; Washington
Irving, at 77; and Thomas de Quincey, at 76.</p>

<p class='c021'>Lady Charlotte Bury, the novelist, attained the age of
88, retaining her beauty and conversational accomplishments
to the last; she died 1861.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Dowager Countess of Hardwicke, who died in 1858,
in her long life brought points of time together which, at
first, seem separated by impassable spaces. She was born
in 1763, and was consequently 95 years of age; but her
father, the Earl of Balcarres, having been advanced in years
at the time of her birth, their two lives extend back to before
the beginning of the eighteenth century; and it was strange
to hear, in 1858, that a person just dead could speak of her
father as having been “out in the Fifteen” (1715) with Lord
Derwentwater and Forster, and having been begged off by
the great Duke of Marlborough. Yet such was the fact; and
not only so, but having been born in 1649, the three lives of
grandfather, son, and granddaughter stretched over a period
of 200 years; and, when her grandmother was married,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Charles II. gave away the bride! When this venerable lady
was born, Pitt the younger was 4 years old; Fox, a lad of
14; and Sheridan of 12,—so that they were strictly her contemporaries;
Burke was turned of 30; she was 21 years old
when Dr. Johnson died, and a well-grown girl when Goldsmith
died, so that she might have known them both; and
Sir Joshua Reynolds may have painted her, as she was near
30 when he died. All the literature of this century, running
back to the birth of Scott and Wordsworth, eight or nine
years after her own, was as much hers as ours. She was
married and 26 before the French Revolution began; and
the whole of the American Revolution must have been within
her personal recollection.</p>

<p class='c021'>Then there was Viscountess Keith, who died at about
the same age, 95, and who had been “the plaything often,
when a child,” of Johnson, and who received his last blessing
on his death-bed. She was the daughter of Mrs. Thrale,
and was a link that directly connected us with the Literary
Club at its foundation, all the members of which she must
have seen, and most of whom she was old enough to know
well as a grown-up young lady.</p>

<p class='c021'>Lady Louisa Stuart, the daughter of the Marquess of
Bute, actually remembered her grandmother, Lady Mary
Wortley Montague, who died in 1762. She herself died
1851, aged 94, and was the intimate friend of Scott, and one
of the few original depositaries of the Waverley secret.</p>

<p class='c021'>And Mary Berry, aged 89, and her sister Agnes, 88, both
died in 1852, having lived in the best of London society for
sixty years. For the amusement of these ladies, Horace
Walpole wrote his most delightful <i>Reminiscences</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LONGEVITY AND DIET.</h3>

<p class='c023'>It may now be as well to glance at the modes of living
of a few of the patriarchal folks. Cornaro, who is one
of the <i>penates</i> of healthful longevity, was born at Venice in
1464, of a noble family. In early life he injured his health
by intemperance, and by indulging his propensity to anger;
but he succeeded in acquiring such a command over himself,
and in adopting such a system of temperance, as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>recover his health and vigour, and to enjoy life to an extreme
old age. At 83 he wrote a comedy “abounding with
innocent mirth and pleasant jests.” At 86 he wrote: “I
contrive to spend every hour with the greatest delight and
pleasure.” He was fond of literature and the conversation
of men of sense and good manners, and his principal delight
was to be of service to others. Every year he travelled,
visited architects, painters, sculptors, musicians, and husbandmen;
and he was especially fond of natural scenery.
“Being freed, by God’s grace, from the perturbations of the
mind and the infirmities of the body,” he no longer experienced
any of those contrary emotions which torment a
number of young men, and many old ones destitute of
strength and health, and every other blessing. His diet
consisted of bread, meat, eggs, and soup, not exceeding in
the day three-quarters of a pound of food, and a pint of new
wine. He passed with health and comfort beyond his hundredth
year; and at Padua, in 1566, sitting in his arm-chair,
he died, as he had lived for his last threescore years, exempt
from pain and suffering.</p>

<p class='c021'>Thomas Parr<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c025'><sup>[50]</sup></a> was an early riser. Taylor, the Water-poet,
quaintly sings of his mode of living:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Good wholesome labour was his exercise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Down with the lamb, and with the lark would rise;</div>
      <div class='line'>In wise and toiling sweat he spent the day,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to his team he whistled time away;</div>
      <div class='line'>The cock his night-clock, and till day was done,</div>
      <div class='line'>His watch and chief sun-dial was the sun.</div>
      <div class='line'>He was of old Pythagoras’ opinion,</div>
      <div class='line'>That new cheese was most wholesome with an onion;</div>
      <div class='line'>Coarse meslin bread; and for his daily swig,</div>
      <div class='line'>Milk, butter-milk, and water, whey and whig;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sometimes metheglin, and, by fortune happy,</div>
      <div class='line'>He sometimes sipped a cup of ale most nappy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cider or perry, when he did repair</div>
      <div class='line'>To a Whitson ale, wake, wedding, or a fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or when in Christmas-time he was a guest,</div>
      <div class='line'>At his good landlord’s house among the rest;</div>
      <div class='line'>Else he had little leisure-time to waste,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or at the alehouse buff-cup ale to taste;</div>
      <div class='line'>His physic was good butter, which the soil</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Salop yields, more sweet than Candy-oil;</div>
      <div class='line'>And garlic he esteemed above the rate</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Venice treacle, or best mithridate;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>He entertained no gout, no ache he felt,</div>
      <div class='line'>The air was good and temperate where he dwelt;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus living within bounds of Nature’s laws,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his long-lasting life may be some cause.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Taylor thus describes the person of Parr:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>From head to heel, his body had all over</div>
      <div class='line'>A quick-set, thick-set, natural hairy cover.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The Vegetarians maintain that their system of living conduces
highly to longevity. We find in the <i>Gentleman’s Magazine</i>,
1774, this recorded instance: “At Brussels, Elizabeth
de Val, aged 103, who was remarkable for never having eaten
a bit of meat in her life.”</p>

<p class='c021'>An advocate of vegetable diet adduces the Norwegian
and Russian peasantry as the most remarkable instances of
extreme longevity: “The last returns of the Greek Church
population of the Russian empire give (in the table of the
deaths of the male sex) more than one thousand above 100
years of age, many between 140 and 150.... Slaves in the
West Indies are recorded from 130 to 150 years of age.”
Widow Rogers, of Penzance, Cornwall, who died 1779, aged
118, for the last sixty years lived entirely on vegetable diet.</p>

<p class='c021'>Among the Pythagoreans of our time should be mentioned
Sir Richard Phillips, who from his twelfth year
conceived an abhorrence of the slaughter of animals for
food; and from that period to his death, at the age of 72,
he lived entirely on vegetable products, enjoying such robust
health that no stranger could have suspected his studious
and sedentary habits.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c025'><sup>[51]</sup></a> Sometimes this Pythagorean
principle was strongly enunciated; as, when about to take
his seat at a supper-party, perceiving a lobster on the table,
he loudly denounced the cruelty of his friends’ sitting down
to eat a creature which had been boiled alive! and the offensive
dish had to be removed. Sir Richard often published
his Reasons for not eating Animal Food; his abstinence drew
upon him the harmless ridicule of a writer in the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>, observing that, although he would not eat meat, he
was addicted to gravy over his potatoes.</p>

<p class='c021'>One Wilson, of Worlingworth, Suffolk, who died 1782,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>aged 116, for the last forty years of his life supped off
roasted turnips, to which he ascribed his long life.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Hon. Mrs. Watkins, of Glamorganshire, who died
1790, aged 110, for her last thirty years lived principally on
potatoes. The year before her death she came from Glamorgan
to London to see Mrs. Siddons play, and attended
the theatre nine nights; and one morning she mounted to
the Whispering-gallery of St. Paul’s Cathedral.</p>

<p class='c021'>It is rarely that table-wits attain such longevity as did
Captain Morris, the Anacreon of the Beef-steak Club, who
wrote lyrics at the age of 90. He died three years afterwards.
He was of short stature, and usually wore a buff
waistcoat, such as he apostrophised in one of his latest
lyrics, “The old Whig Poet to his old Buff Waistcoat.” He
lies in the churchyard of Betchworth, Surrey,—his grave
simply marked by a head and foot stone, 1838.</p>

<p class='c021'>Civic annals present few such instances of long life as
that of Richard Clark, Chamberlain of London, who died
1831, in his 92d year. He was one of the latest of the contemporaries
of Dr. Johnson, whom he had known from his 15th
year: when sheriff, he took the Doctor to a “Judges’ Dinner”
at the Old Bailey, the judges being Blackstone and Eyre.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the autumn of 1831 died the Rev. Dr. Shaw, aged 83,
of Chesley, Somerset, said to have been the last surviving
friend of Dr. Johnson.</p>

<p class='c021'>Few persons addicted to riotous living attain great ages.
A remarkable exception is recorded of George Kirton, Esq.,
of Oxcrop Hall, Yorkshire, who died in 1762, aged 125. He
was a stanch foxhunter, and hunted till after he was 80;
thenceforth, till his hundredth year, he attended the “breaking
cover” in his single chair. He was a heavy drinker till
within a few years of his death.</p>

<p class='c021'>Thomas Whittington, who died at Hillingdon, Middlesex,
in 1804, aged 104, retained his faculties to the last, and
could walk two or three miles; yet he was a great drinker,
gin being the only fluid he took into his stomach, and of
this a pint and a half daily, until a fortnight of his death.
He remembered William III. and Queen Anne; and in
1745 he conveyed troops and baggage from Uxbridge to
London. His father died at exactly the same age (104) as
the son, and both lie in Hillingdon churchyard.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f50'>
<p class='c021'><a href='#r50'>50</a>. <span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>In the Ashmolean Collection at Oxford is a portrait of Old Parr, presumed
to have been painted from the life, and, we believe, not engraved. The portrait
by Rubens is well known.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f51'>
<p class='c021'><a href='#r51'>51</a>. The portrait of Sir Richard Phillips as Sheriff, painted by Saxon, shows
him as above described. The picture is of gallery size, and in the possession

The bust of Sir Richard, by Turnerelli, conveys a similar <i>personnel</i>.</p>
</div>

<hr class='c027' />

<h3 class='c012'>LONGEVITY AND LOCALITIES.</h3>

<p class='c023'>With respect to the atmosphere most favourable to health
and longevity, Sir John Sinclair says, “More depends upon
a current of pure air than mere elevation. There is no place
in Scotland, proportionably with its population, where a
greater number of aged people are to be found than in the
neighbourhood of Loch Lomond.” The purest atmosphere,
Sir John maintains, is in the neighbourhood of a small
stream running over a rocky or pebbly bottom.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Thomas Bailey, in his <i>Records of Longevity</i>, states
that “Nottinghamshire has the driest atmosphere of any
district in England, the depth of rain which falls there
being something like 50 per cent below what falls in Lancashire,
Devonshire, and one or two of the northern counties;”
yet the records show that it enjoys no superiority, in
point of the longevity of its inhabitants, over those moister
districts. Hence it is concluded that moderately moist air is
most conducive to great age. The reason Hufeland assigns
for this is, that moist air, being in part already saturated, has
less attractive power over bodies,—that is to say, consumes
them less. Besides, in a moist atmosphere there is always
more uniformity of temperature, fewer rapid revolutions of
heat being possible than in a dry atmosphere. Lastly, an
atmosphere somewhat moist keeps the muscular tissue of
the body longer pliable, whereas that which is dry or arid
brings on much sooner rigidity of the muscles and vessels
of the body, and all the characteristics of old age. It is this
very dry air, joined with the heat of the sun, which gives to
the dried and shrivelled skin of the face of some old men,
in the felicitous humour of Charles Dickens, “the appearance
of a walnut-shell.”</p>

<p class='c021'>We now proceed to cite instances of Long Life from various
localities. On the fly-leaves of a book named <i>Long
Livers</i>, published in 1722, were written the following notes
of several old persons in Yorkshire: Ursula Chicken, at
Holderness, 120 years in 1718, and she lived some years
later. In Firbeck churchyard were buried a brother and
son, one 113 and the other 109 years old, both of whom had
lived in caves at Roche Abbey. Mr. Philip, of Thorner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>born in Cleveland (the birthplace of Old Jenkins), had his
picture taken when he was 116 years old, with all his senses
perfect. Thomas Rudyard, Vicar of Everton, in Bedfordshire,
died in King Charles’s time, aged 140 years, as appears
by the parish register. Early in June 1768 died, at
Burythorpe, near Malton, Francis Consit, aged 150 years.
A few years previously there were three women, each 100
years old, or upwards, who lived in and about Whitwell,
met at that town and danced a Yorkshire reel. About 1758
a woman died at Sutton 107 years old. “Old Robinson’s
father, at Boltby, lived to 108,” and he himself beyond 98.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c025'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>The register of Middleton Tyas, adjoining, contains,
in sixteen years, entries of 230 persons buried, of whom
seventy-six had reached the age of 70 years or upwards.
In 1813, of fifteen deceased, three were 90, 91, and 92; in
1815 a person died 97; and thirty-three of the number specified
were 80 years old and upwards; and in the churchyard
are buried two persons of 103 and 101 years. But
within the last thirty-five years instances of longevity in
this parish, once so common, form the exception.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Durrant Cooper, F.S.A., has communicated to <i>Notes
and Queries</i>, No. 212, these interesting records from the
burial register of Skelton-in-Cleveland, in the North Riding
of Yorkshire:</p>

<p class='c028'>Out of 799 persons buried between 1813 and 1852, no less than 263,
or nearly one-third, attained the age of 70. Of these, two were respectively
101. Nineteen others were 90 years of age and upwards, viz.
one 97, one 96, one 95, four 94, one 93, five 92, three 91, and three 90.
Between the ages of 80 and 90 there died 109; and between 70 and 80
there died 133. In one page of the register, containing eight names,
six were above 80, and in another five were above 70.</p>

<p class='c041'>In the parish of Skelton there was then living a man named Moon,
104 years old, who was blind, but managed a small farm till nearly or
quite 100; and a blacksmith, named Robinson Cook, aged 98, who
worked at his trade until within six months of this age.</p>

<p class='c041'>In the chapelry of Brotton, adjoining Skelton township, the longevity
was even more remarkable. Out of 346 persons buried since the
new register came into force in 1813, down to Oct. 1, 1853, more than
one-third attained the age of 70. One Betty Thompson, who died in
1834, was 101; nineteen were more than 90, of whom one was 98, two
97, three 95, one 93, four 92, five 91, and three 90; forty-four died
between 80 and 90 years old, and fifty-seven between 70 and 80, of
whom thirty-one were 75 and upwards. That celibacy did not lessen
the chance of life was proved by a bachelor named Simpson, who died
at 82, and his maiden sister at 91.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Gilling, in Richmondshire, shows also a very great length
of life, and in persons above 90 years of age a larger proportion
even than in the Cleveland parishes. Between
1813 and 1853, of 701 persons buried, 207, or rather more
than one-third, attained the age of 70 and upwards. Three
were 100, or upwards; between 90 and 100, twenty-one; one
96, 95, and 94; two 92, six 91, and ten 90. Between 80 and
90 there died 87; between 70 and 80, ninety-six.</p>

<p class='c021'>George Stephenson, a farm-labourer, of Runald-Kirk,
near Barnard-Castle, Durham, who died 1812, aged 105, was
a very early riser; he used to reprove (for lying a-bed) his
daughter and her husband, both about 70 years of age, but
who rose before six o’clock in the morning,—George saying,
“if they would not work while they were <i>young</i>, what
would they do when they became old?”</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Carruthers, of Inverness, whose evidence is entitled
to respect, wrote in 1836, that “the patriarchs of the glen
of Strathcarron have been gathered to their fathers. The
primitive manners of the olden time are disappearing even
in that remote corner, and human life is dwindling down
to its ordinary brief limits.” This experience is the converse
of the opinion that civilisation and refinement tend to
lengthen life.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Western Isles of Scotland have long been noted for
persons of great age. Martin describes a male native of
Jura, who had kept 180 Christmas festivals in his own
house, and this marvellous account was confirmed to Pennant;
but the evidence is not given, and the man died fifty
years before Martin’s visit. Buchanan, in his <i>History of
Shetland</i>, gives an account of one Laurence, a Shetlander,
who lived to 140; Dr. Derham, in his <i>Physico-Theology</i>, confirms
this, and Martin received from Laurence’s family particulars
of his fishing to the last year of his life. At Orkney
Martin heard of a man aged 112; and that one William
Muir, of Westra, lived to be near 140. Tarquis M’Leod,
near Stornoway, in the island of Lewis, died in 1787, aged
113; he had fought at Killiecrankie, Sheriffmuir, and Culloden,
under the Stuarts.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the <i>Aberdeen Journal</i> we find this evidence: Died,
at Strichen, Widow Reid, aged 81; and in the following
fortnight, Christian Grant, aged 97 years. The surviving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>resident paupers number only twenty-five, and among them
there are seven individuals whose respective ages are 92, 90,
88, 86, 83, 82, and 80 years—making a total of 601 years, and
an average of nearly 86 years to each. These statistics, in
a parish containing a population of only 947, are perhaps
unparalleled in Scotland.</p>

<p class='c021'>A well-authenticated instance is that of Mrs. Elizabeth
Gray, who died at Edinburgh on the 2d of April 1856, at
the age of 108, having been born in May 1748, as chronicled
in the register of her father’s parish. Her mother attained
96, and two of her sisters died at 94 and 96 respectively.
In 1808 died the Hon. Mrs. Hay Mackenzie, of
Cromartie, at the age of 103. The well-known Countess
Dowager of Cork died in 1840, having just completed her
94th year; she was to the last accustomed to dine out
every day when she had not company at home. Mr. Francis
Brokesby, in 1711, wrote of a woman then living near
the Tower of London, aged about 130, and who remembered
Queen Elizabeth; to the last there was not a gray
hair on her head, and she never lost memory or judgment.
Mr. Brokesby also records the death, about 1660, of the
wife of a labouring man at Hedgerow, in Cheshire; she is
said to have attained the age of 140.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c025'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Reflecting upon this record, Mr. Robert Chambers observes,
with poetic feeling, “When we think of such things,
the ordinary laws of nature seem to have undergone some
partial relaxation; and the dust of ancient times almost
becomes living flesh before our eyes.” We confess to the
weakness of being occasionally depressed in the society of
some very aged persons. We remember Louis Pouchée to
have died about twenty years since, considerably above 100
years old: his voice was a childish treble, and there was at
last a sort of forced gaiety in his manner which was any
thing but cheerful; his piping of “I’ve kissed and I’ve
prattled with fifty fair maids” was a lugubrious rendering of
that lively lyric.</p>

<p class='c021'>In White’s <i>Suffolk Directory</i> for 1844, the following living
instances are recorded. “W. A. Shuldham, Esq., resides at
the Hall, in which, on July 18, 1843, he celebrated the hundredth
anniversary of his birthday. Mrs. Susan Godbold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>who was born at Flixton, has resided at Metfield eighty
years, and walked round the village on her 104th birthday,
Sept. 13, 1843. Thomas Morse, Esq., of Lound, is now in
his 99th year.” Dr. Smith, residing at Bawdsea, a few years
since completed his 109th; when, in the fulness of his
spirits, he expressed a belief that he should live for some
years to come.</p>

<p class='c021'>Here is an instance of remarkable memory. George
Kelson (”the Woodman,” in illustration of Cowper’s poem)
died near Bath in 1820, aged 101; he gave evidence before
the Commissioners of Public Charities, deposing, with great
clearness, to facts which had occurred ninety years before
his examination.</p>

<p class='c021'>The parish register of Bremhill, Wiltshire, records:
“Buried, September the 29th, 1696, Edith Goldie, Grace
Young, Elizabeth Wiltshire. Their united ages make 300
years.”<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c025'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Two centuries ago, the now sleepy town of Woodstock,
Oxon., was proverbial for its long livers. The Rev. John
Ward, Vicar of Stratford-upon-Avon, in his Diary, 1648-9,
records: “Old Bryan, of Woodstock, a taylor by profession,
and a fiddler by present practice, of age 90, yet very
lively, and will travail well. George Green and Cripps,
each 90, very hard labourers. Thomas Cock, <i>alias</i> Hawkins,
112 years of age when he died. Woodstock men frequently
long lived. Goody Jones, of Woodstock, and old
Bryan, two such old people as it is thought England does
not afford, nor two such travailors of their age.”</p>

<p class='c021'>In 1637 there was living in Blackboy-lane, Oxford, “Mother
George,” who, although 120 years of age, could thread
a fine needle without the help of spectacles.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c025'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Between February and May 1767, there died in Oxford
seven persons whose ages together amount to 616, viz. 88,
93, 86, 87, 90, 82, and 90. In the same year is recorded
the death of Francis Ange, in Maryland, aged 130; he was
born at Stratford-upon-Avon, remembered the death of King
Charles I., and left England soon after.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c025'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>The heads of Colleges in Oxford have frequently attained
great ages: we have mentioned Dr. Routh, President
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>of Magdalen, who died in his 100th year. There are generally
very old people living in Oxford; and at Iffley the
ages recorded in the churchyard commonly exceed 70.</p>

<p class='c021'>Midhurst, in Sussex, must be a healthy locality; for,
according to the <i>Dublin Chronicle</i>, December 2, 1788, the
town, then containing only 140 houses and cottages, had
seventy-eight inhabitants whose ages were above 70; thirty-two
were 80 and upwards; and five were between 90 and
100; and the seventy-eight persons, except four, were in
some business or occupation.</p>

<p class='c021'>Wye, near Ashford, Kent, is another noted locality for
long life; the ages of 70, 80, and even 90, being by no
means rare in the parish register.</p>

<p class='c021'>In 1800 twenty-two men died in England and Wales
who had reached or passed the age of 100, and forty-seven
women. The oldest woman, 111 years of age, died in Glamorganshire.
With the men there was a tie: a man aged
107 died in Hampshire, and another of the same age in
Pembrokeshire. Four of the centenarians died in London,
two others at Camberwell, one also at Greenwich, and
one at Lewisham. More men died in the year than women;
but of the 595 persons who had reached the age
of 95 or upwards before they died, nearly two-thirds were
women.</p>

<p class='c021'>Great longevity is attained in some of the murky streets,
lanes, and alleys of London. In 1767 died Widow Prossen,
of Oxford-road, in her 102d year, having passed nearly her
whole life among old clothes in a pawnbroker’s shop, accumulating
a large fortune. In the same year died her neighbour,
Benjamin Perryn, aged 103.</p>

<p class='c021'>In 1767 also we find Widow Waters, of Saffron-hill,
dying at the age of 103; and one Wood, of Markam-court,
Chandos-street, at 100.</p>

<p class='c021'>In 1846 there died in grimy Holywell-street, Strand,
one Harris, a Jew clothesman, who had lived in the same
street more than seventy years: his wife died a few years
before him, at the age of 93; and his eldest son was 73 at
the time of his father’s death. In 1780 there died in St.
Martin’s workhouse Widow Pettit, aged 114; and next year,
Widow Parker, of White-Hart-yard, Drury-lane, aged 108,
with all her faculties unimpaired.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>In 1788 there died at Hoxton, aged 121, a widow, who,
up to a very advanced period, cried gray peas for sale about
the streets of London; and was well remembered by many
aged persons as a woman apparently beyond the middle
stage of life, full twenty years before the time of her decease.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c025'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Occasionally we find very old persons almost <i>growing to
the spot</i> on which they were born. In 1780 died at Englefield,
Hants, James Hopper, an agricultural labourer, aged
108, who had never quitted his native Englefield even for
a few miles. And in 1799 died Mr. Humphries, a carpenter,
born at Newington, Surrey, aged 102, and who would
never go more than two or three miles from the house in
which he was born. One Trundle, a farmer of Rotherhithe,
who died 1766, aged 100, had lived in the same house
eighty-two years. Sometimes this takes the turn of misanthropic
seclusion: Christopher Tarran, of Sutton, near
Richmond, Yorkshire, who died 1827, aged 93, shut himself
up in his chamber, from which he never stirred during the
last twenty years of his life, and only twice admitted any
one into the room. In 1811 there died at Desford, Leicestershire,
one John Upton, aged 100; he had been a worsted
framework-knitter for one firm in Leicester for ninety-three
years.</p>

<p class='c021'>Widow Richardson, of Holwell, Leicestershire, who died
1806, aged 97, kept school in the parish 75 years, and was
never five miles from home during her long life.</p>

<p class='c021'>We remember two stalwart millers, brothers, Joseph
and John Saunders, aged 79 and 73, born at Pixham-mill,
and then of Pixham-house, hard by, near the foot of Boxhill,
Surrey, where they died, at the above ages.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LONGEVITY OF CLASSES.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Deep-thinking philosophers have at all times been distinguished
by their great age, especially when their philosophy
was occupied in the study of Nature, and afforded
them the divine pleasure of discovering new and important
truths,—the purest enjoyment; a beneficial exaltation of ourselves,
and a kind of restoration which may be ranked among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>the principal means of prolonging the life of a perfect being.
The most ancient instances are to be found among the Stoics
and the Pythagoreans, according to whose ideas subduing
the passions and sensibility, with the observation of strict
regimen, were the most essential duties of a philosopher.
Thus, we have the examples of a Plato and an Isocrates.
Apollonius of Tyana, an accomplished man, endowed with
extraordinary powers both of body and mind, who by the
Christians was considered as a magician, and by the Greeks
and Romans as a messenger of the gods, in his regimen a
follower of Pythagoras, and a friend to travelling, was above
100 years of age. Xenophilus, a Pythagorean also, lived 106
years. The philosopher Demonax, a man of the most severe
manners and uncommon stoical apathy, lived likewise 100.
Even in modern times philosophers seem to have obtained
this preëminence; and the deepest thinkers appear in that
respect to have enjoyed, in a higher degree, the fruits of
their mental tranquillity. Kepler and Bacon both attained
to a great age; and Newton, who found all his happiness
and pleasure in the higher spheres, attained to the age of
84. Euler, a man of incredible industry, whose works on
the most abstruse subjects amount to above three hundred,
approached near to the same age; and Kant, who reached
the age of 80, showed that philosophy not only can preserve
life, but that it is the most faithful companion of the greatest
age, and an inexhaustible source of happiness to one’s self
and to others. Academicians, in this respect, have been
particularly distinguished. We need only mention the
venerable Fontenelle,<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c025'><sup>[58]</sup></a> who wanted but one year of a hundred,
and that Nestor, Formey; both perpetual secretaries,
the former of the French, and the latter of the Berlin Academy.</p>

<p class='c021'>We find also many instances of long life among schoolmasters,
so that one might almost believe that continual
intercourse with youth may contribute something towards
our renovation and support. But poets and artists, in short
all those fortunate mortals whose principal occupation leads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>them to be conversant with the sports of fancy and self-created
worlds, and whose whole life, in the properest sense,
is an agreeable dream, have a particular claim to a place in
the history of longevity. Anacreon, Sophocles, and Pindar
attained a great age. Young, Voltaire, Bodmer, Haller, Metastasio,
Gleim, Utz, and Oeser, all lived to be very old; and
Wieland, the prince of German poets, lived to the age of
80. (See <i>Wilson on Longevity</i>.)</p>

<p class='c021'>Among the clergy are several remarkable instances. The
venerable Bishop Hough, the Cato of Sir Thomas Bernard’s
<i>Comforts of Old Age</i>, through an extraordinary degree of
health of body and mind, attained the age of 92. “Blessed
be God for his great mercies to me! I have to-day entered
my ninetieth year, with less infirmity than I could have presumed
to hope, and certainly with a degree of calmness and
tranquillity of mind, which is gradually increasing as I
daily approach the end of my pilgrimage. I think, indeed,
that my life must now be but of short duration; and, I thank
God, the thought gives me no uneasiness.”<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c025'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Sancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury, after he had been
deprived and ejected from Lambeth, for refusing to take
any new oaths to William and Mary, retired to his paternal
estate, of 50<i>l.</i> a year, at Fresingfield, in Suffolk, his birthplace.
He was then approaching fourscore; and here he
was visited by Bishop Hough, in 1693.</p>

<p class='c028'>I found him (says the Bishop) working in his garden, and taking
advantage of a shower of rain which had fallen to transplant some lettuces.
I was struck with the profusion of his vegetables, the beauty
and luxuriance of his fruit-trees, and the richness and fragrance of his
flowers, and noticed the taste which had directed every thing. “You
must not compliment too hastily (says he) on the <i>directions</i> which I
have given. Almost all you see is the work of my own hands. My old
woman does the weeding, and John mows my turf and digs for me; but
all the nicer work,—the sowing, grafting, budding, transplanting, and
the like,—I trust to no other hand but my own; so long, at least, as my
health will allow me to enjoy so pleasing an occupation. And in good
sooth (added he) the fruits here taste more sweet, and the flowers have
a richer perfume, than they had at Lambeth.” I looked up to our deprived
metropolitan with more respect, and thought his gardening-dress
shed more splendour over him, than ever his robes and lawn-sleeves could
have done when he was the first subject in this great kingdom.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c025'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c023'>The Rev. Mr. Sampson, Incumbent of Keyham, Leicestershire,
who died 1655, is stated by Thoresby to have held the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>living of his parish 92 years; so that he could scarcely be
less than 116 years old.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Rev. R. Lufkin, Rector of Ufford, Suffolk, died September
1678, aged 110, having preached the Sunday before
he died.</p>

<p class='c021'>Morton, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, who died 1695,
aged 95, constantly rose at four o’clock to his studies when
he was 80 years old; he usually lay upon a straw bed, and
seldom exceeded one meal a day.</p>

<p class='c021'>Here are two lengthy incumbencies: “1753, December 22.
Rev. Mr. Braithwaite, of Carlisle, [died] aged 110. He had
been 100 years in the cathedral, having commenced singing-boy
in the year 1652.” “1763. Rev. Peter Alley (Rector of
Donamow, Ireland, 73 years), [died] in the 111th year of his
age. He did his own duty till within a few days of his death;
he was twice married, and had thirty-three children.”<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c025'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>The Rev. John Bedwell, Rector of Odstock, near Salisbury,
according to the Bishop’s registry, held that benefice
73 years; and, by the parish register, died at the age of 108.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Rev. S. W. Warneford, the munificent benefactor to
colleges and schools, died 1855, aged 92; and Maltby, Bishop
of Durham, 1859, at 90.</p>

<p class='c021'>Soldiers who survive the chances of war are proverbial
for long life: there are several instances recorded in the
Chelsea Hospital burial-ground. The lists of the survivors
of England’s great battles present instances ranging from
100 to 120 years.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c025'><sup>[62]</sup></a> The oldest General of our time was
Marshal Count Joseph Radetzsky, who died January 5, 1858,
in his 92d year.</p>

<p class='c021'>“History only mentions a single man who, at such an
advanced age, commanded an army in the field; and that
was Dandolo, the Doge of Venice, who was 95 years of age,
and almost blind, when he commanded the Venetians in the
great Crusade, and who was the first to enter Constantinople
at the time of the assault on it in 1203. Talbot, Earl of
Shrewsbury, was 83 years old when he commanded in
Guienne, in 1453; but he was killed in the same year at
the battle of Chatillon. Fuentes, General of the Spanish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>troops at the battle of Rocroy, in 1643, was 82; but he was
gouty, and was carried in an arm-chair. He fell in that
battle, and with him disappeared the glory of the Spanish
arms. The Prussian Field-Marshal Mollendorf was present,
in his 82d year, at the defeat of Auerstadt, but not as commander-in-chief.
One octogenarian of modern times has
been more fortunate than the preceding, and that is Marshal
de Villars, who, in his 81st year, undertook the campaign
of 1712, crowned by the victory of Denain, which
saved the French monarchy.”<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c025'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Quakers attain great ages. In the Obituary of the <i>Friend</i>
Magazine, 1860, we find the following ages of some deceased
members of the Society of Friends: 84, 84, 85, 85, 85, 86,
86, 87, 87, 88, 88, 89, 89, 89, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 91, 92, 92, 93,
93—making a total of 2128 years, with an average for each
life of rather more than 88½ years. Fifty lives in the same
period give 4258 years, with an average of 85 per life. The
average duration of life in the Society of Friends during
1860 was 58 years and 6 months; but one girl died under 6
months old; five girls and thirteen boys—in all eighteen out
of the 324, or 5½ per cent—did not reach the age of one year.</p>

<p class='c021'>Hard-workers are often long livers. Hobson, the noted
Cambridge carrier, died on New-year’s Day, 1630-1, it is said
in his 86th year. His visits to London were suspended on
account of the Plague, and during this cessation he died;
whereupon Milton remarked that Death would never have
hit him had he continued dodging it backwards and forwards
between Cambridge and the Bull Inn, Bishopsgate.</p>

<p class='c021'>One John King, of Nokes, Oxon, died in 1766, at the age
of 130: he was a farm-labourer, and at the age of 128
walked to and from the market at Oxford—twelve miles. One
Wilks, a farm-labourer, of Stourbridge, Worcestershire, who
died 1777, aged 109, was suspected by his ignorant neighbours
of having purchased the secret of long life from a
witch with whom he had become acquainted.</p>

<p class='c021'>An Irish fisherman, Jonas Warren, who died 1787, Mr.
Bailey states, at 167, had for ninety-five years drawn his
subsistence from the ocean. Another fisherman, Worrell,
of Dunwich, Suffolk, died 1789, aged 119, having fished till
he was 107.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>On June 3, 1862, there died at his farm, Tullyskerra,
near Castleblayney, Gilbert Hand, at the advanced age of
105 years. Two days before his death deceased travelled
round his farm, apparently taking his last farewell of the
fields in which he so often toiled.</p>

<p class='c021'>Of Ephraim Pratt, who was living at Shaftesbury, U.S.,
in 1803, aged 116 years, the Rev. Timothy Dwight relates
that he had mown grass 101 years successively. He drank
large quantities of milk, and in his latter years it was
almost his sole sustenance. His descendants, to the fifth
generation, it was publicly stated, numbered more than
1500 persons.</p>

<p class='c021'>Margaret Woods, of Great Waltham, who died 1797, aged
100, had, with her ancestors, lived in the service of one
Essex family for 400 years.</p>

<p class='c021'>Here is well-authenticated evidence of long service from
Sussex. At Battle is the gravestone of Isaac Ingoll, who
died April 2, 1798, aged 120 years; his register is to be seen
in the parish, and he lived 101 years in the service of the
Webster family, of Battle Abbey, having entered it at the
age of 19.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c025'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Philip Palfreman, who had been box-keeper at the first
Covent Garden Theatre in Garrick’s time, died in 1768,
aged 100: he almost lived in the theatre, and by his thrift
saved a fortune of 10,000<i>l.</i> In 1845 died William Ward, aged
98, of the Sun Fire Office, London, where he had filled a
situation seventy years.</p>

<p class='c021'>Jockeys, from the severe effects of training, are proverbially
short-lived; yet John Scott, of Brighton, once a jockey,
reached the age of 96.</p>

<p class='c021'>Great pedestrian feats have been performed by very old
men. Mr. M’Leod, of Inverness, who died 1790, aged 102,
two years previously walked from Inverness to London
(five hundred miles) in nineteen days: he had served in
Marlborough’s wars.</p>

<p class='c021'>On May 28, 1802, a lunatic named James Coyle, 47 years
old, was admitted a patient into St. Patrick’s (Swift’s) Hospital,
Dublin: he continued there upwards of fifty-eight
years, and eventually died July 17, 1860, at the age of 105.
There can surely be no mistake as to this great age.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Peter Breman, of Dyott-street, St. Giles’s, London, is
one of the few instances on record of long life attained by
tall men: he stood 6 feet 6 inches high, and was in the
army from the age of 18 nearly until his decease, in 1769, at
the age of 104 years. Another tall man, Edmund Barry, of
Watergrass-hill, Ireland, died 1822, aged 113: he was 6 feet
2 inches in height, and walked well to the last.</p>

<p class='c021'>One John Minniken, of Maryport, Cumberland, who died
1793, aged 112, was remarkable for the fast growth and profusion
of his hair, which he sold, in successive croppings,
to a hairdresser of the town, for a penny a day, during the
remainder of his life; and more than seventy wigs were
made of Minniken’s hair.</p>

<p class='c021'>Among aged persons of diminutive stature was Mary
Jones, of Wem, Salop, who died 1773, aged 100: she was
only 2 feet 8 inches in height. Elspeth Watson, of Perth,
who died 1800, aged 115, did not exceed 2 feet 9 inches in
height, but was bulky in person.</p>

<p class='c021'>Old age can rarely withstand intense grief. John Tice,
of Hagley, Worcestershire, having recovered from a fall out
of a tree when he was 80 years old, and from being much
burned when he was 100, after the death of his patron,
Lord Lyttleton, became so depressed in spirits, that he
took to his bed and died. Sir Francis Burdett had withstood
the storms and tumults of political life for more than
half a century, and had reached the age of 74, when his
dear wife died, Jan. 10, 1844: from that instant Sir Francis
refused food or nourishment of any kind, and he died of
intense grief on the 23d of the same month: both were
buried in the same vault, in the same hour, on the same
day, in the church of Ramsbury, Wilts.</p>

<p class='c021'>Cardinal Fleury, the great French minister, who died in
1743, had attained the age of 90. For fourteen years he essentially
contributed to the peace and prosperity of France;
but the three last years of his administration were unfortunate.
On the death of the Emperor Charles XI., in 1740,
without male issue, a war ensued respecting the imperial
succession, the calamitous events of which preyed on the
Cardinal’s mind and occasioned his death.</p>

<p class='c021'>Sir John Floyer, Physician to Queen Anne, seems to
have found the golden mean of happiness. He died in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>1734; four years previous to which he visited Bishop Hough,
at Hartlebury. “Sir John Floyer (writes the Bishop to a
friend) has been with me some weeks; and all my neighbours
are surprised to see a man of eighty-five, who has his
memory, understanding, and all his senses good; and seems
to labour under no infirmity. <i>He is of a happy temper, not
to be moved with what he cannot remedy;</i> which I really believe
has, in a great measure, helped to preserve his health
and prolong his days.” This is the grand secret. Sir John
wrote a curious Essay on Cold Bathing, among the benefits
of which he does not omit long life.</p>

<p class='c021'>Dr. Cheyne, the Scottish physician, of this period, in his
well-known Essay, advocates strict regimen for preventing
and curing diseases: by milk and vegetable diet he reduced
himself from thirty-two stone weight almost a third,
recovered his strength, activity, and cheerfulness, and attained
the good age of 72.</p>

<p class='c021'>Jeremy Bentham, the eminent philosophical jurist and
writer on legislation, died in 1832, in Queen-square-place,
Westminster, where he had resided nearly half a century, in
his 85th year. Up to extreme old age he retained much of
the intellectual power of the prime of manhood, the simplicity
and freshness of early youth; and even in the last moments
of his existence the serenity and cheerfulness of his
mind did not desert him. “He was capable,” says Dr. Southwood
Smith, to whom he bequeathed his body for purposes
of anatomical science, in the lecture delivered over his remains,
“of great severity and continuity of mental labour.
For upwards of half a century he devoted seldom less than
eight, often ten, and occasionally twelve hours of every day
to intense study. This was the more remarkable as his physical
constitution was by no means strong. His health during
the periods of childhood, youth, and adolescence was
infirm; it was not until the age of manhood that it acquired
some degree of vigour; but that vigour increased with advancing
age, so that during the space of sixty years he
never laboured under any serious malady, and rarely suffered
even from slight indisposition; and at the age of 84
he looked no older, and constitutionally was not older, than
most men are at 60; thus adding another illustrious name
to the splendid catalogue which establishes the fact, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>severe and constant mental labour is not incompatible with
health and longevity, but conducive to both, provided the
mind be unanxious and the habits temperate.</p>

<p class='c021'>“He was a great economist of time. He knew the value
of minutes. The disposal of his hours, both of labour and
of repose, was a matter of systematic arrangement; and the
arrangement was determined on the principle that it is a
calamity to lose the smallest portion of time. He did not
deem it sufficient to provide against the loss of a day or an
hour; he took effectual means to prevent the occurrence of
any such calamity to him. But he did more: he was careful
to provide against the loss of even a single minute; and
there is on record no example of a human being who lived
more habitually under the practical consciousness that his
days are numbered, and that ‘the night cometh in which no
man can work.’”</p>

<p class='c021'>It should, however, be added, that Mr. Bentham’s lot
in life was a happy one. Even though he did not enjoy
a widely diffused reputation in his own country, and his
peculiar views exposed him to the attacks of contemporary
writers, his easy circumstances and excellent health
enabled him to devote his whole time and energies to
those pursuits which exercised his highest faculties, and
were to him a rich and unfailing source of the most delightful
excitement. His retired habits likewise preserved
him from personal contact with any but those who valued
his acquaintance; and as for the writers who spoke of him
with ridicule and contempt, he never read them, and therefore
they never disturbed the serenity of his mind, or ruffled
the tranquil surface of his contemplative and happy life.</p>

<p class='c021'>It would be well for public writers if they possessed
more of such equanimity as Mr. Bentham’s, to shield them
from the venom of adverse criticism and the attacks of
those dishonest critics who abuse every indication of success
which they conceive to stand in the way of their own
advancement. We have something of the old leaven of
Grub-street in our times, though the name is blotted out
from our metropolitan streetology. It is true that the
patronage of great men is no longer valued by men of
letters,—it is but as dust in the balance against the weight
of public opinion,—but something of the old trade of factious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>criticism which Swift, Pope, and Warburton so mercilessly
exposed, has survived even to our days.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Thackeray, to our thinking one of the most masculine
and unaffected writers of his day, has well described
the Grub-street association of “author and rags—author
and dirt—author and gin,” such as were the literary hacks
of the reign of George II.; but literature now takes its rank
with other learned professions.</p>

“If I can only hold out till strawberries come in, I shall get well.” His long life
may, however, rather be attributed to his insensibility, of which he himself
boasted: he was rarely known to laugh or cry.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>Great Ages</h3>

<p class='c023'>To return to Longevity. The following additional instances
are mostly of our own time:</p>

<p class='c028'>Among Lawyers, Francis Maseres, fifty years Cursitor-Baron of the
Court of Exchequer, died 1824, at the age of 93: he was a ripe classical
scholar, and one of the ablest mathematicians of his day. The
Eldon family present three noteworthy examples: Mr. Scott, the Newcastle
merchant, father of Lord Stowell and the Earl of Eldon, died
1800, at the age of 92: the two eminent sons, Stowell, 1836, at 91,
and Eldon, 1838, at 87. Lord Plunket, the statesman and lawyer,
who died 1854, had reached 90. Lord Chancellor Campbell, who in
his busy law-life wrote many volumes of biography, attained the age
of 81.</p>

<p class='c041'>Sir William Blizard, the Surgeon, who died in 1835, in his 94th year,
rose to eminence under many disadvantages. With all his activity and
industry, except a fever caught by working night and day in the dissecting-room,
his health never failed him till the last; he was temperate;
and the only wine he drank was Cape. Sir William Burnett, the physician
and scientific inventor, reached 82.</p>

<p class='c041'>In 1862 two eminent Mathematicians died within a month of each
other: Jean Baptiste Biot, aged 88; and Peter Barlow, 86. Prof. Narrien,
of Sandhurst, died 1860, at 77; and, same year and age, Finlaison,
the actuary.</p>

<p class='c041'>Francis Place, the Westminster Politician, who died 1854, had
reached 82. The Duc de Pasquier, the celebrated French statesman,
attained the great age of 96: he died 1862, and was the oldest statesman
of our time. Talleyrand, next to Napoleon the most extraordinary
man of the revolutionary period of France, died 1838, aged 84.</p>

<p class='c041'>The oldest Poets of our time were W. L. Bowles, 1850, aged 88;
same year, Wordsworth, poet-laureate, 80; James Montgomery, 1854,
at 82; Samuel Rogers, 1855, aged 96; Arndt, the German poet, 1860,
at 91; and Dr. Croly, the poet and divine, 86.</p>

<p class='c041'>Mitscherlich, the German Philologist, died 1854, at 94; same year,
Gresnall, biographer, 89, and Faber, theologian, 80. Hamner-Purgstall,
the Oriental historian, who died 1856, had attained 87; 1857,
Hincks, the Orientalist, 90.</p>

<p class='c041'>Sir John Stoddart, the Newspaper editor, who died 1855, had
reached 85,—a rare age for a public journalist. John Sharpe, the
tasteful <i>littérateur</i>, who died 1860, reached 83.</p>

<p class='c041'>Dr. Lingard, the Historian, died 1851, aged 82. In 1859, Hallam, the
historian; same year, Elphinstone, the historian of India, aged 81.</p>

<p class='c041'>John Britton, the Topographer and antiquary, who died 1857, had
reached 86: he was cheerful and chirping almost to the end. His
brother topographer, Brayley, died 1854, aged 85. John Adey Repton,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>the architect and archæologist, died 1860, aged 86; Joseph Hunter,
archæologist, 1861, 78.</p>

<p class='c041'>Kirby, the Entomologist, who died 1860, had reached 91. Professor
Jameson, the naturalist, died 1854, aged 81. Brunel, the engineer of
the Thames Tunnel, died 1849, aged 81. Captain Manby, who invented
apparatus for saving shipwrecked persons, and who died 1854, had
reached 89. Sir John Ross, the Arctic navigator, died 1856, at 79. The
chemists, Andrew Ure, at 79, and Thenard, at 80, died 1857. Baron
Humboldt, who died 1859, reached 92; same year, Sir G. Staunton, the
Chinese scholar, at 79. Colonel Leake, the geographer, 1860, at 83;
and in the same year Carl Ritter, the geographer, 81; and Bishop Rigaud,
astronomer, 85.</p>

<p class='c041'>In 1858 died an unusually large number of Men of Science and Letters,
and Artists, at great ages. Count Radetzsky, at 92; Creuzer, the
German antiquary, 87; Thomas Tooke, political economist, 85; three
musical composers, Neukomm, 80; J. B. Cramer, 88; and Horsley, 84;—Esenbach,
botanist, 82; Aimé de Bonpland, 85; Robert Brown, botanist,
84; Bunting, Wesleyan preacher, 80; Mrs. Marcet, educational writer,
89; Edward Pease, “the Father of Railways,” 92; Robert Owen, socialist,
87; Richard Taylor, of the <i>Philosophical Magazine</i>, 77.</p>

<p class='c041'>In 1860 we lost the following eminent Engineers: Vicat (France),
aged 75; General Pasley, 80; Eaton Hodgkinson, 72; Sir Howard
Douglas, 86. In 1862 there died General Tulloch, at 72; and James
Walker, at 81; and in 1860, Jesse Hartley, 80.</p>

<p class='c041'>Charles Macklin, the oldest English Actor and playwright, who died
1797, had reached the age of 107: for his last twenty years he never
took off his clothes, except to change them, or to be rubbed over with
warm brandy or gin; he ate, drank, and slept without regard to set
times, but according to his inclination.</p>

<p class='c041'>M. Delphat, the French Musician, who died 1855, had reached 99;
and in the same year died Robert Linley, the violoncellist, at 83. John
Braham lived far beyond the usual age of singers, namely, to his 82d
year: he died February 17, 1856; he first sung in public when ten
years old. Ludwig Spohr, the German composer, died 1859, at 80.</p>

<p class='c041'>Some aged persons have literally fallen asleep in death. Sir Christopher
Wren passed his latter years at Hampton Court, and his townhouse
in St. James’s-street. He caught cold, and this hastened his
death. He was in town; he was accustomed to sleep a short time after
dinner; and on February 25, 1723, his servant, thinking his master had
slept longer than usual, went into his room, and found Wren dead in
his chair; he was in his 91st year. James Elmes, who wrote Wren’s
life, died 1862, aged 80.</p>

<p class='c041'>Copley, the Painter, died 1815, aged 78; his son, Lord Lyndhurst,
in 1863, attained his 91st year: his mother lived to see her son a
second time Lord High Chancellor. Stothard, for several months before
his decease, though his bodily infirmities prevented his attending to his
labours as an artist, would not relinquish his attendance at the meetings
and lectures of the Royal Academy and in the library, notwithstanding
extreme deafness prevented his hearing what was passing.
Mr. Constable, in a letter to a friend, written in 1838, says: “I passed
an hour or two with Mr. Stothard on Sunday evening. Poor man! the
only elysium he has in this world he finds in his own enchanting works.
His daughter does all in her power to make him happy and comfortable.”
Leslie remarks that Stothard must have possessed great constitutional
serenity of mind; he was also, no doubt, much supported by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>his art. His easel, indeed, bore evidence of the many years he had
passed before it; the lower bar, on which his foot rested, being nearly
worn through. He died April 27, 1834, in his 80th year, at his house
in Newman-street, where he had resided more than forty years.</p>

<p class='c041'>Sir M. A. Shee, Painter, P.R.A., died 1850, at the age of 80. J. M. W.
Turner, the greatest landscape painter, R.A., 1851, at 77; and 1854, Geo.
Clint, painter of humour, 82; Wachter, the famous historical painter,
who died 1852, reached 90. Two aged Frenchmen died 1853: Fontaine,
the architect, 90; and Renouard, bibliographer, 98. James Ward, the
animal painter, who died 1859, reached 91; Alfred Chalon, 1860, at
80; and in 1859, David Cox, founder of our Water-Colour School, 76.</p>

<p class='c041'>In 1850 died Schadow, the Hungarian Sculptor, 86. In 1856, Sir R.
Westmacott, the sculptor, R.A.; and next year, Christian Rauch, the
German sculptor, at 80.</p>

<p class='c041'>Matthew Cotes Wyatt, the Sculptor of the colossal Wellington statue,
died 1862, at 86. The oldest engraver of the above period was John
Landseer, who died 1852, aged 90.</p>

<p class='c041'>Sir John Soane, R.A., the Architect, died 1837, having reached the
age of 84, bequeathing his museum, in Lincoln’s-inn Fields, to the
nation. Sir John was the son of a Berkshire bricklayer, and by his own
energy rose to eminence as an architect: he designed a greater number
of public edifices than any contemporary. His last work (1833), the
State-Paper Office, in St. James’s-park, was very unlike any other of
his designs; it was taken down in 1862.</p>

<p class='c041'>Foster, the Artist, of Derby, celebrated the hundredth anniversary
of his birthday on November 8, 1862, when he was entertained by his
friends in the county hall. Mr. Foster served under Abercrombie in
Egypt, and left the army on the day on which Nelson died. He has
been five times married; and his youngest child, born sixty-eight years
after his eldest, is now (1862) only ten years of age.</p>

<p class='c023'>The great ages in the following records must be considered
very remarkable:</p>

<p class='c028'>Mr. Henry H. Breen, writing from St. Lucia, states that Louis Mutal,
a Negro, died in the island in 1851, at the age of 135 years. Mutal was
a native of Macouba, in the island of Martinique, and about 1785 settled
in St. Lucia as a dealer in trade; after his death was found among his
papers his marriage contract with his slave, Marie Catherine, in 1771,
which establishes the fact of his being then 55 years of age, and consequently
of his having been born in 1716. This is followed by a certificate,
showing that the marriage contract was published and recorded
in 1772. The date of his death in the parish register has been carefully
verified by Mr. Breen, who adds: “There are now living in this island
several persons of the age of 90, or upwards,” in a population of about
26,000 souls. The particulars are:</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE HAPPY OLD MAN.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The wisest and best productions of the human intellect,
says Dr. Moore,<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c025'><sup>[67]</sup></a> have proceeded from those who have lived
through the bustling morning and meridian periods of their
day, and calmly sat down to think and instruct others in
the meditative evening of life. Even when the brilliancy
of reason’s sunset yields to the advancing gloom, there is
an indescribable beauty haunting the old man still, if in
youth and vigour his soul was conversant with truth; and
even when the chill of night is upon him, his eye seems to
rest upon the glories for awhile departed; or he looks off
into the stars, and reads in them his destiny with a gladness
as quiet and as holy as their light.</p>

<p class='c021'>How instructive is the usual state of memory and hope
in advanced life! As the senses become dull, the nervous
system slow, and the whole body unfit for active uses, the
old man necessarily falls into constant abstraction. Like
all debilitated persons, he feels his unfitness for action,
and, of course, becomes querulous if improperly excited.
Peacefulness, gentle exercise among flowers and trees, unstimulating
diet, and the quiet company of books and philosophic
toys, are suitable for him. With such helps his
heart will beat kindly, and his intellect, however childlike,
will maintain a beautiful power to the last. Objects of affection
occasionally move him with more than their accustomed
force. Young children are especially agreeable to
him. When approaching him with the gentle love and
reverence which unspoiled childhood is so apt to exhibit,
his heart seems suddenly to kindle as the little fingers
wander over his shrivelled hand and wrinkled brow. He
smiles, and at once goes back in spirit to his childhood,
and finds a world of fun, frolic, and liveliness before him;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>and he has tales of joy and beauty, which children and age
and holy beings can best appreciate. Next to the children
of his children, the old man, whose thoughts have been
directed by the Bible, loves the society of persons of holy
habits; and as he finds these more frequently among females,
such are generally his associates. But all aged and
infirm persons he deems fit company, because they, like
himself, are busied in reviewing past impressions, rather
than planning or plotting for a livelihood, or reasoning
about ways and means. The past is his own, and he cons
it over like a puzzling but at least an interesting lesson.
If his soul have been trained to delight in truth, his will
becomes weaned from this world of effort in proportion as
he feels the weakness that disqualifies him from struggling
on in it. Yet <i>in our ashes live their wonted fires:</i> he feels an
internal, a spiritual energy, awakening in a new manner the
sympathies that belong to his being, and he feels as if his
affections had been laid by to ripen into an intensity out of
keeping with the usages and objects about him. He realises
most fully the facts of a coming life, and even now lives
apart from the present; and if his habits of reflection be
not distracted, and his heart broken by hard and ignorant
treatment, and if his soul have not been wedded to care by
a love of gold without the possibility of divorce, and mammon
have not branded his spirit with indelible misery,
then is the old man ready to enter on a purely spiritual existence
with alacrity and joy.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PREPARATORY TO DEATH.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Jeremy Taylor, in his <i>Holy Dying</i> (General Considerations
Preparatory to Death), has this memorable passage,
in which he illustrates the daily experiences of every
thoughtful mind:</p>

<p class='c028'>And because this consideration is of great usefulness and of great necessity
to many purposes of wisdom and the spirit, all the succession of
time, all the changes in nature, all the varieties of light and darkness,
the thousand thousands of accidents in the world, and every contingency
to every man and to every creature, doth preach our funeral
sermon, and calls us to look and see how the old sexton Time throws
up the earth and digs a grave where we must lay our sins or our sorrows,
and sow our bodies till they rise again in a fair or in an intolerable
eternity. Every revolution which the sun makes about the world
divides between life and death; and death possesses both those portions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>by the next morrow, and we are dead to all those months which we
have already lived, and we shall never live them over again: and still
God makes little periods of our age. First we change our world, when
we come from the womb to feel the warmth of the sun. Then we sleep
and enter into the image of death, in which state we are unconcerned
in all the changes of the world [who hath not felt this when stretched
upon his bed at the close of day?]: and if our mothers or our nurses die,
or a wild boar destroy our vineyards, or our king be sick, we regard it
not, but during that state are as disinterested as if our eyes were closed
with the clay that weeps in the bowels of the earth. At the end of
seven years our teeth fall and die before us, representing a formal prologue
to the tragedy; and still every seven years it is odds but we shall
finish the last scene: and when nature, or chance, or vice, takes our
bodies in pieces, weakening some parts and loosing others, we <i>taste the
grave</i> and the solemnities of our own funerals, first in those parts that
ministered to vice, and next in them that served for ornament; and
in a short time even they that served for necessity become useless,
and entangled like the wheels of a broken clock. <i>Baldness</i> is but a
dressing to our funerals, the proper ornament of mourning, and of a
person entered very far into the regions and possession of death: and
we have many more of the same signification: gray hairs, rotten teeth,
dim eyes, trembling joints, short breath, stiff limbs, wrinkled skin, short
memory, decayed appetite. Every day’s necessity calls for a reparation
of that portion which death fed on all night when we lay in
his lap and slept in his outer chambers. The very spirits of a man
prey upon the daily portion of bread and flesh, and every meal is a
rescue from one death, and lays up for another: and while we think a
thought we die; and the clock strikes, and reckons on our portion of
eternity; we form our words with the breath of our nostrils, we have
the less to live upon for every word we speak.</p>

<p class='c041'>Thus nature calls us to meditate of death by those things which are
the instruments of acting it: and God by all the variety of his Providence
makes us see death every where, in all variety of circumstances, and
dressed up for all the fancies and the expectation of every single person.</p>

<p class='c041'>Nature hath given us one harvest every year, but death hath two:
and the spring and the autumn sends throngs of men and women to
charnel-houses; and all the summer long men are recovering from their
evils of the spring, till the dog-days come, and then the Syrian star
makes the summer deadly; and the fruits of autumn are laid up for all
the year’s provision, and the man that gathers them eats and surfeits,
and dies and needs them not, and himself is laid up for eternity; and
he that escapes till the winter only stays for another opportunity, which
the distempers of that quarter minister to him with great variety. Thus
death reigns in all the portions of our time. The autumn with its fruits
provides disorders for us, and the winter’s cold turns them into sharp
diseases, and the spring brings flowers to strew our hearse, and the
summer gives green turf and brambles to bind upon our graves. Calentures
and surfeit, cold and agues, are the four quarters of the year,
and all minister to death; and you can go no whither but you tread upon
a dead man’s bones.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>DEATH BEFORE ADAM.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Two hundred years ago, long before the science of Geology
called for the belief that mortality had been stamped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>on creation, and had manifested its proofs in the animal
races previously to Adam’s appearance, Jeremy Taylor could
write as follows regarding Adam himself before the Fall.
He considers him to have been created mortal; not merely
liable to become mortal, but actually mortal.</p>

<p class='c021'>“For ‘flesh and blood,’ that is, whatsoever is born of
Adam, ‘cannot inherit the kingdom of God.’ And they are
injurious to Christ who think that from Adam we might
have inherited immortality. Christ was the giver and
preacher of it; ‘he brought life and immortality to light
through the Gospel.’”</p>

<p class='c021'>Again: “For that Adam was made mortal in his nature
is infinitely certain, and proved by his very eating and
drinking, his sleep and recreation, &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='c021'>And in another passage, quoted by Professor Hitchcock:
“That death which God threatened to Adam, and which
passed upon his posterity, is not the going out of this
world, but the manner of going. If he had stayed in innocence,
he should have gone placidly and fairly, without vexatious
and affective circumstances; he should not have died
by sickness, defect, misfortune, or unwillingness.” These
sentiments Archdeacon Pratt<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c025'><sup>[68]</sup></a> quotes, not as necessarily
approving them, but to show that so good and learned a
man as Jeremy Taylor had a view regarding death and mortality
no less unusual than that which Geology demands.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>FUTURE EARTHLY EXISTENCE OF THE HUMAN RACE.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Regarding Man, independently of any revealed knowledge
of his future destiny, but simply with reference to his
relations with the physical world about him, Mr. Hopkins,
the able geologist, asks: “Do we see in his character and
position here any indication that this earth is his destined
abiding place for indefinite periods of time? We conceive
that a negative answer to the question is suggested at least
by the fact that the extent of the earth’s surface and its
powers of production are <i>finite</i>, whereas the tendency in
human population to increase is unlimited. It is undoubtedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>easy to conceive this tendency to be arrested, but not
probably by causes consistent with the moral and physical
well-being of the race. Whether human population may
have increased or not during the last two thousand years,
is a matter of little import, we conceive, to the question before
us. We know that it is now spreading itself over many
parts of the globe, under influences far different from those
under which it has heretofore extended,—the influence of
Christianity, and of that higher civilisation which must attend
the pure doctrines of our religion. We believe that
this extension and increase of the civilised races of mankind
will continue; and, however it may be temporarily checked
by the hardships and evils to which man is subject, we can
hardly understand how this tendency can be effectively and
finally arrested before the population of the globe shall have
approximated to that limit which must be necessarily imposed
upon it by the finite dimensions of man’s dwelling-place.
We know not what might be the views of political
economists on this ultimate condition of human population;
but we feel it difficult to conceive its existence, under
merely human influences, independently of physical want,
and possibly of that moral debasement which so frequently
attends it. In fact, those who regard man simply in his
human character and in his relations to <i>nature</i>, and not in
his relations to God, must find in his earthly future the
most insoluble problem which can offer itself to the speculative
philosopher. It would seem equally difficult to
assign to the human race an indefinite term of existence,
or to sweep it away by natural causes from the face of the
earth. But it is in such questions as this that a steady
faith in man’s Creator and Redeemer affords to the embarrassed
mind a calm and welcome resting-place. Those who
believe man’s introduction on the earth to have been a direct
act of his Almighty Creator, will not think it necessary to
look for his final earthly destiny in the operation of merely
secondary causes, but will refer it to the same Divine Agency
as that to which he refers the origin of the race.”<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c025'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c006'>The School of Life.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c012'>WHAT IS EDUCATION?</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Bishop Burnet</span> seems to have given the reply in the fewest
words when he observes: “The education of youth is the
foundation of all that can be performed for bettering the
next age.”</p>

<p class='c021'>“Education,” says Paley, “in the most extensive sense of
the word, may comprehend every preparation that is madef
in our youth for the sequel of our lives; and in this sense
I use it. Some such preparation is necessary for all conditions,
because without it they must be miserable, and
probably will be vicious, when they grow up, either from the
want of the means of subsistence, or from want of rational
and inoffensive occupation. In civilised life, every thing is
affected by art and skill. Whence a person who is provided
with neither (and neither can be acquired without exercise
and instruction) will be useless, and he that is useless will
generally be at the same time mischievous, to the community.
So that to send an uneducated child into the world
is injurious to the rest of mankind; it is little better than
to turn out a mad dog or a wild-beast into the streets.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Who are the uneducated? is a question not easily to be
answered in a time when books have come to be household
furniture in every habitation of the civilised world. All that
men have contrived, discovered, done, felt, or imagined, is
recorded in books; wherein whoso has learned to spell
printed letters may find such knowledge, and turn it to advantageous
account.</p>

<p class='c021'>D’Israeli the younger, in one of his politico-economic
speeches, remarks: “As civilisation has gradually progressed,
it has equalised the physical qualities of man. Instead
of the strong arm, it is now the strong head that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the moving principle of society. You have disenthroned
Force, and placed on her high seat Intelligence; and the
necessary consequence of this great revolution is, that it has
become the duty and the delight equally of every citizen to
cultivate his faculties.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>TEACHING YOUNG CHILDREN.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Coleridge relates that Thelwall thought it very unfair to
influence a child’s mind by inculcating any opinions before
it should have come to years of discretion, and be able to
choose for itself. “I showed him my garden,” says Coleridge,
“and told him it was my botanical garden.” “How
so?” said he; “it is covered with weeds.” “Oh!” I replied,
“that is only because it has not yet come to its age of discretion
and choice. The weeds you see have taken the
liberty to grow, and I thought it unfair in me to prejudice
the soil towards roses and strawberries.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Madame de Lambert, in her work <i>Sur l’Education d’une
jeune Demoiselle</i>, says: “The greatest enemy that we have
to combat in the education of children is self-love; and to
this enemy we cannot give attention too early. Our business
is to weaken it, and we must be careful not to strengthen
it by indiscriminate praise. Frequent praise encourages
pride, induces a child to value herself as superior to her
companions, and renders her unable to bear any reproach
or objection however mild. We should be cautious, even in
the expression of affection, not to lead children to suppose
that we are constantly occupied with them. Timid children
may be encouraged by praise; but it must be judiciously
bestowed, and for their good conduct, not for personal
graces. Above all things, it is necessary to inspire them
with a love of truth; to teach them to practise it at their
own expense; and to impress it upon their minds that there
is nothing so truly great as the frank acknowledgment, ‘I
am wrong.’”</p>

<p class='c021'>Harriet Martineau observes: “It is a matter of course
that no mother will allow any ignorant person to have access
to her child who will frighten it with goblin stories or threats
of the old black man. She might as well throw up her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>charge at once, and leave off thinking of household education
altogether, as permit her child to be exposed to such
maddening inhumanity as this. The instances are not few
of idiotcy or death from terror so caused.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Children should not be hedged-in with any great number
of rules and regulations. Such as are necessary to be
established, they should be required implicitly to observe.
But there should be none that are superfluous. It is only
in rich families, where there is a plentiful attendance of
governors and nurses, that many rules can be enforced;
and it is believed that the constant attention of governors
and nurses is one of the greatest moral disadvantages to
which the children of the rich are exposed.</p>

<p class='c021'>Coleridge has well said: “The most graceful objects in
nature are little children—before they have learned to
dance.”</p>

<p class='c021'>“Grace,” says Archbishop Whately, “is in a great measure
a natural gift; elegance implies cultivation, or something
of more artificial character. A rustic, uneducated girl
may be graceful, but an elegant woman must be accomplished
and well trained. It is the same with things as with
persons; we talk of a graceful tree, but of an elegant house
or other building. Animals may be graceful, but they cannot
be elegant. The movements of a kitten or a young
fawn are full of grace; but to call them ‘elegant’ animals
would be absurd. Lastly, ‘elegant’ may be applied to
mental qualifications, which ‘graceful’ never can. Elegance
must always imply something that is made or invented by
man. An imitation of nature is not so; therefore we do
not speak of an ‘elegant picture,’ though we do of an elegant
pattern for a gown, an elegant piece of work. The
general rule is, that elegance is the characteristic of art,
and grace of nature.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>EDUCATION AT HOME.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Education at Home has been thus aptly illustrated:
History and Geography should begin at home. If we want
a boy to know some day the families of the Herods and the
Cæsars, let him start by learning who was his own grandfather.
The Church Catechism rightly commences by making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the child tell his own name; it would be in many cases
almost puzzling, but in all cases and senses a most proper
question, to ask him, further, the names of his godfathers
and godmothers; and so carrying him gradually onward, he
would know, what seldom happens, the kings of England
before he attempts those of Israel and Judah. This principle
holds as true of places as of persons. The things that
touch us nearest interest us most. Geography should begin
from the school-walls: “Which side of this room does the
sun rise on?” “Does Church-lane run west or north?” “Whither
does the brook flow that rises on Squash-hill?” In
this way the young scholar would in time be brought to
comprehend the round world and his own position on it,
and probably with some clearer perception of the truth and
relation of things than if he had begun by rote: “The earth
is a terraqueous globe, depressed at the poles, consisting
of,” &amp;c. But we are all taught on the contrary plan. We
begin at the wrong end; for, in the ladder of learning, <i>Ego</i>,
not Adam, is the true No. 1. We start from the equator
instead of High-street, and the result is the lamentable fact,
that even educated men are strangers in their own country,
and thousands die within the sound of Bow-bells who have
never seen the inside of St. Paul’s. Topography, then, should
precede geography. Yet perhaps there is not a schoolroom
in England where a county map is to be found hung up on
the wall. Frightened by the remembrance of having been
once the deluded subscriber to a Topographical Dictionary,
even students have a horror of the word; and the subject is
consigned, in expensive folios, to a few professed antiquaries,
or to some eccentric member of a county family, who
emerges every third or fourth generation to preserve a provincial
dignity which he would not willingly let die.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c025'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>TENDERNESS OF YOUTH.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Leaving home the first time, for school, has been thus
pathetically described by Southey: “The pain which is
felt when we are first transplanted from our native soil,
when the living branch is cut from the parent tree, is one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>of the most poignant griefs which we have to endure through
life. There are after-griefs which wound more deeply,
which leave behind them scars never to be effaced, which
bruise the spirit, and sometimes break the heart: but never
do we feel so keenly the want of love, the necessity of being
loved, and the utter sense of desertion, as when we first
leave the haven of home, and are, as it were, pushed off
upon the stream of life.” Nelson, when he was sent a boy
first to rough it out at sea, felt this loneliness most acutely:
he paced the deck most of the day without being noticed by
any one; and it was not till the second day that somebody,
as he expresses it, “took compassion on him.” Nelson had
a feeble body and an affectionate heart, and he remembered
through life his first days of wretchedness in the service.</p>

<p class='c021'>Humanity to animals has been thus eloquently enjoined
upon children by Dr. Parr: “He that can look with rapture
upon the agonies of an unoffending and unresisting animal,
will soon learn to view the sufferings of a fellow-creature with
indifference: and in time he will acquire the power of viewing
them with triumph, if that fellow-creature should become
the victim of his resentment, be it just or unjust. But the
minds of children are open to impressions of every sort,
and indeed wonderful is the facility with which a judicious
instructor may habituate them to tender emotions. I have
therefore always considered mercy to beings of an inferior
species as a virtue which children are very capable of learning,
but which is most difficult to be taught if the heart
has been once familiarised to spectacles of distress, and has
been permitted either to behold the pangs of any living
creature with cold insensibility, or to inflict them with
wanton barbarity.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>BUSINESS OF EDUCATION.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Among the many recommendations which will always
attach to a public system of education, the value of early
emulation, the force of example, the abandonment of sulky
and selfish habits, and the acquirement of generous, manly
dispositions, are not to be overlooked. To begin at the
beginning is the only royal road to learning; and this is
only to be reached by attention to elementary truths. Yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>this is difficult, even for cultivated men. “In reality,” says
Dr. Temple, “elementary truths are the hardest of all to
learn, unless we pass our childhood in an atmosphere thoroughly
impregnated with them; and then we imbibe them
unconsciously, and find it difficult to perceive their difficulty.”<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c025'><sup>[71]</sup></a>
Yet how few children have this advantage: so
many false impressions are received in childhood, that the
first business of education proper is to <i>unlearn</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'>The superior influence of example over precept is thus
eloquently illustrated by Carlyle: “Is not love, from of old,
known to be the beginning of all things? And what is
admiration of the great but love of the truly lovable? The
first product of love is imitation, that all-important peculiar
gift of man, whereby mankind is not only held socially together
in the present time, but connected in like union with
the past and future; so that the attainment of the innumerable
departed can be conveyed down to the living, and
transmitted with increase to the unborn. Now, great men,
in particular spiritually great men (for all men have a spirit
to guide, though all have not kingdoms to govern and battles
to fight), are the men universally imitated and learned
of, the glass in which whole generations survey and shape
themselves.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Lord Jeffrey has remarked upon the necessity of early
restraint, that</p>

<p class='c028'>Young people who have been habitually gratified in all their desires
will not only more indulge in capricious desires, but will infallibly take
it more amiss when the feelings or happiness of others require that they
should be thwarted, than those who have been practically trained to
the habit of subduing and restraining them; and consequently will in
general sacrifice the happiness of others to their own selfish indulgence.
To what else is the selfishness of princes and other great people to be
attributed? It is in vain to think of cultivating principles of generosity
and beneficence by mere exhortation and reasoning. Nothing but the
<i>practical habit</i> of overcoming our own selfishness, and of familiarly
encountering privations and discomfort on account of others, will ever
enable us to do it when required. And therefore I am firmly persuaded
that indulgence infallibly produces selfishness and hardness of heart,
and that nothing but a pretty severe discipline and control can lay the
foundation of a magnanimous character.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE CLASSICS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Especially was Dr. Arnold an orthodox Oxonian in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>belief of the indispensable usefulness of Classical Learning,
not only as an important branch of knowledge, but as the
substantial basis of education itself, the importance of which
he thus forcibly illustrates: “The study of Greek and Latin,
considered as mere languages, is of importance mainly as it
enables us to understand and employ well that language in
which we commonly think and speak and write. It does
this because Greek and Latin are specimens of language
at once highly perfect and incapable of being understood
without long and minute attention: the study of them,
therefore, naturally involves that of the general principles
of grammar; while their peculiar excellences illustrate the
points which render language clear and forcible and beautiful.
But our <i>application</i> of this general knowledge must
naturally be to our own language: to show us what are its
peculiarities, what its beauties, what its defects; to teach
us, by the patterns or the analogies offered by other languages,
how the effect we admire in them may be produced
with a somewhat different instrument. Every lesson in
Greek or Latin may and ought to be made a lesson in English;
the translation of every sentence in Demosthenes or
Tacitus is properly an extemporaneous English composition;
a problem, how to express with equal brevity, clearness,
and force, in our own language, the thought which
the original author has so admirably expressed in his.”</p>

<p class='c021'>In other words, Dr. Arnold was the first English commentator
who gave life to the study of the Classics, by
bringing the facts and manners which they disclose to the
test of real life.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Buckle, siding with the anti-classicists, remarks that,
“With the single exception of Porson, not one of the great
English scholars has shown an appreciation of the beauties
of his native language; and many of them, such as Parr (in
all his works) and Bentley (in his mad edition of Milton)
have done every thing in their power to corrupt it. And
there can be little doubt that the principal reason why well-educated
women write and converse in a purer style than
well-educated men, is because they have not formed their
taste according to those ancient classical standards, which,
admirable as they are in themselves, should never be introduced
into a state of society unfitted for them. To this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>may be added, that Cobbett, the most racy and idiomatic
of all our writers, and Erskine, by far the greatest of our
forensic orators, knew little or nothing of any ancient language;
and the same observation applies to Shakspeare.”<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c025'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Our author has been just to Porson, to whom chiefly
English scholarship owes its accuracy and its certainty;
and this as a branch of education—as a substratum on
which to rest other branches of knowledge often infinitely
more useful in themselves—really takes as high a rank as
any of those studies which can contribute to form the character
of a well-educated English gentleman.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LIBERAL EDUCATION.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Dean Hook has written the following able defence of a
Liberal Education, as distinguished from the special training
for a profession:</p>

<p class='c028'>A Liberal Education is to the present time the characteristic of
what is called a University Education. By a liberal education is meant
a non-professional education. By a non-professional education is
meant an education conducted without reference to the future profession,
or calling, or special pursuit for which the person under education
is designed. It is an education which is regarded not merely as
a means, but as something which is in itself an end. The end proposed
is not the formation of the divine, or the physician, or the lawyer, or
the statesman, or the soldier, or the man of business, or the botanist,
or the chemist, or the man of science, or even the scholar; but simply
of the thinker.</p>

<p class='c041'>It is admitted that the highest eminence can only be attained by
the concentration of the mind, with a piercing intensity and singleness
of view, upon one field of action. In order to excel, each mind must have
its specific end. A man may know many things well, but there is only
one thing upon which he will be preëminently learned, and become an
authority. The professional man may be compared to one whose eye is
fixed upon a microscope. The rest of the world is abstracted from his
field of vision, and the eye, though narrowed to a scarcely perceptible
hole, is able to see what is indiscernible by others. When he observes
accurately, he becomes, in his department, a learned man; and when he
reveals his observations, he is a benefactor of his kind. All that the
university system does is to delay the professional education as long as
possible; it would apply to the training of the mind a discipline analogous
to that which common sense suggests in what relates to bodily
exercise. A father, ambitious for his son that he might win the prize
at the Olympian games or in the Pythian fields, devoted his first attention
not to the technicalities of the game, but to the general condition
and morals of the youth. The success of the athlete depended upon
his first becoming a healthy man. So the university system trains the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>man, and defers the professional education as long as circumstances
will permit. It makes provision, before the eye is narrowed to the
microscope, that the eye itself shall be in a healthy condition; it expands
the mind before contracting it; it would educate mind as such
before bending it down to the professional point; it does not regard the
mind as an animal to be fattened for the market, by cramming it with
food before it has acquired the power of digestion, but treats it rather
as an instrument to be tuned, as a metal to be refined, as a weapon to
be sharpened.</p>

<p class='c041'>This is the system which the old universities of Europe have inherited.</p>

<p class='c041'>Philology, logic, and mathematics are still the instruments employed
for the discipline of the mind, which is the end and object of a
Liberal Education.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c025'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c023'>The best education has been thus bodied forth: “Let a
man’s pride be to be a gentleman: furnish him with elegant
and refined pleasures, imbue him with the love of intellectual
pursuits, and you have a better security for his
turning out a good citizen and a good Christian, than if
you have confined him by the strictest moral and religious
discipline, kept him in innocent and unsuspecting ignorance
of all the vices of youth, and in the mechanical and orderly
routine of the severest system of education.”<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c025'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c023'>Dr. Arnold, from his entering upon the head-mastership
of Rugby, threw himself into the great work of school reform,
based upon the associations of his boyhood, and the
convictions of his more mature experience. “To do his
duty was the height of his ambition,—those truly English
sentiments by which Nelson and Wellington were inspired;
and, like them, he was crowned with victory; for soon were
verified the predictions of the Provost of Oriel, that <i>he would
change the face of education through the public schools of England</i>.
He was minded, <i>virtute officii</i>, to combine the care
of souls with that of the intellects of the rising generation,
and to realise the Scripture in principle and practice, without
making an English school a college of Jesuits. His
principles were few: the fear of God was the beginning of
his wisdom; and his object was not so much to teach knowledge,
as the means of acquiring it; to furnish, in a word,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>the key to the temple. He desired to awaken the intellect
of each individual boy, and contended that the main movement
must come from within and not from without the
pupil; and that all that could be, should be <i>done by</i> him
and not <i>for</i> him. In a word, his scheme was to call forth
in the little world of school those capabilities which best

<h3 class='c012'>SCHOOL INDULGENCE.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Nothing is more prejudicial to after-success in life than
indulgence to youth when at school. Sir James Mackintosh
felt and acknowledged this error. He tells us that when
he left school he could only imperfectly construe a small
part of Virgil, Horace, and Sallust: he adds, “Whatever
I have done beyond, has been since added by my own irregular
reading. But no subsequent circumstance could
make up for that invaluable habit of vigorous and methodical
industry which the indulgence and irregularity of my
school-life prevented me from acquiring, and of which I
have painfully felt the want in every part of my life.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Another mistake is a profuse allowance of Pocket-money
at School: we once heard an old Westminster declare that
to his unlimited supply of money when at the college he
attributed over-indulgence in luxuries which had injured
his health, and often rendered him the dupe of mean and
designing persons—full-grown parasites—mischievous as
the plants of that name, which bear down the trees they
attack, and rob them of the food intended for their own
leaves and fruit.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>UNSOUND TEACHING.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The general unsoundness of what is termed an English
education is, to a great extent, accounted for by the little
attention paid in the Universities, Colleges, and Schools to
teaching our native language, and especially to the proper
teaching of English in schools for the people. The results
of this neglect of the mother-tongue are multitudinous. “The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>mass of our population, in spite of all that has been done,
must be considered densely ignorant. Millions never open a
book. Nearly fifteen millions never enter church or chapel.
Other causes may operate, but the want of a knowledge of
language is a potent one. People whose vocabulary is limited
to about three hundred words cannot follow a sermon,
and clergymen who have never been taught the value of
plain Saxon English cannot preach one. Then, amongst the
middle and upper classes, how superficial is the knowledge
of English. How few can write a common letter without
faults in grammar, choice of words, or spelling. Punctuation
is absolutely ignored by many. What are the speeches at
public meetings, or rather, how would they appear in print
but for the talent of the reporters, who bring order out
of chaos? The results of the Civil-Service Examinations
abundantly prove the justice of these strictures; and the
fruits of University training, or rather non-training, are too
patent to require illustration. Our clergy often carry into
the prayer-desk and pulpit all the defects of early life,—the
provincial accent, the sing-song tone, the nasal twang, the
lisp, or burr, or stammer; indistinct utterance, inaudible
reading and vociferation, wrong emphasis, undue stress on
enclitics, and many other faults. Good sermons are the
exception rather than the rule; for if sound in doctrine and
full of zeal, the style is often obscure or pedantic or inflated,
and the delivery monotonous and soporific. In the Senate,
though most of the Members are University men, there are
but few really effective speakers. Were our senators trained
to speak well—that is, to the point—much time would be
saved, and public business despatched more rapidly.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The remedies suggested by the Rev. Dr. D’Orsey are:</p>

<p class='c028'>1. Training-schools for nursery governesses, who, without knowing
or pretending to know French and Italian, should speak English without
vulgarisms. 2. Greater attention in our present training colleges for
schoolmasters to due instruction in English, especially in correct and
fluent speaking. 3. More encouragement to men of talent and education
to become and to remain schoolmasters, by holding out the prospect
of honourable offices to distinguished teachers. Why should
Inspectorships of Schools be always given to clergymen and barristers,
to the exclusion of the schoolmaster? 4. The appointment of a thoroughly
accomplished scholar as English Master in every great public
school, of equal rank with the other masters. 5. The endowment of
at least one Professorship in every University. 6. The recognition of
English as a subject in every examination not strictly scientific, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>rewarding distinction in composition or oratory in the same substantial
manner as eminence in classics or mathematics.</p>

<p class='c023'>Sir John Coleridge relates the following inefficient examples
of school-teaching which have come under his observation:
“An Examiner was about, and he had a class
before him—the first class in arithmetic. They were able
to answer questions; they had gone through all the higher
branches of arithmetic, and were prepared to answer any
thing. But he said, ‘I will give you a sum in simple addition.’
He accordingly dictated a sum, and cautiously interspersed
a good many ciphers. Suppose, for instance, he
said, ‘a thousand and forty-nine.’ He found there was not
one in the class who was able to put down that sum in
simple addition; they could not make count of the ciphers.
That showed him the boys had been suffered to pass over
far too quickly the elementary parts of arithmetic. The examiner
took them in grammar, and quoted a few lines from
Cowper—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I am monarch of all I survey,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>‘What governs right?’ There was not a boy could say, till
it was put to them, ‘none to dispute my right.’</p>

<p class='c021'>“Let me impress upon you that the best motto you can
take for yourselves in this respect is that which was taken
by a most eminent man who made his way from a hair-dresser’s
shop to be Chief Justice Tenterden. What was
his motto? When a man is made a judge, he is made a serjeant;
and as serjeant he gives rings to some of the great
officers of State, with a motto upon each. His motto was
‘Labore.’ He did not refer to his own talents. It was not
‘Invita Minerva.’ To his immortal honour be it said—from
the hair-dresser’s shop in Canterbury to the Free School in
Canterbury; from the Free School in Canterbury to Corpus
Christi College; from Corpus Christi College to the bar;
from the bar to the bench; from the bench to the peerage—he
achieved all with unimpeachable honour, and always
practising that which was his motto at last. One of the
most gratifying scenes I have ever witnessed was when that
man went up to the House of Peers in his robes for the first
time, attended by the whole bar of England.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>SELF-FORMATION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The one great object—the finality—of rational Education
is Self-instruction. In mind as well as body we are children
at first, only that we may afterwards become men; dependent
upon others, in order that we may learn from them such
lessons as may tend eventually to our edification on an independent
basis of our own. The knowledge of facts, or
what is generally called learning, however much we may
possess of it, is useful so far only as we erect its materials
into a mental framework; but useless, utterly, as long as
we suffer it to lie in a heap, inert and without form. The
instruction of others, compared with self-instruction, is like
the law compared with faith; a discipline of preparation,
beggarly elements, a schoolmaster to lead us on to a state
of greater worthiness, and there give up the charge of us.</p>

<p class='c021'>“Every man,” says Gibbon, “who rises above the common
level, receives two educations—the first from his instructors;
the second, the most personal and important,
from himself.” Almost all Lord Eldon’s legal education was
from himself, without even the ordinary helps, which he disdainfully
flung from him; and of no one could it be more
truly predicated, that he was not “rocked and dandled” into
a lawyer.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Rev. Sydney Smith has thus sketched a scheme, in
which he deems it of the highest importance that the education
of a British youth were directed to the true principles
of legislation: what effect laws can produce upon opinions,
and opinions upon laws; what subjects are fit for legislative
interference, and when men may be left to the management
of their own interests. The mischief occasioned by bad
laws, and the perplexity which arises from a multiplicity
of laws; the causes of national wealth; the relations of
foreign trade; the encouragement of agricultures and manufactures;
the fictitious wealth occasioned by paper-credit;
the use and abuse of monopoly; the theory of taxation; the
consequences of the public debt: these are some of the
subjects and some of the branches of civil education, to
which we would turn the minds of future judges, future
senators, and future noblemen. After the first period of
life had been given up to the cultivation of the classics, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>the remaining powers were beginning to evolve themselves,
these are some of the propensities in study which we would
endeavour to inspire.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PRACTICAL DISCIPLINE.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The want of Practical Discipline has been thus put by a
writer in <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i>: “What is the use of battering
a man’s brains full of Greek and Latin pothooks, that
he forgets before he doffs his last round-jacket or puts on
his first long-tailed blue, if ye don’t teach him the old Spartan
virtue of obedience, hard living, early rising, and them
sort of classics? Where’s the use of instructing him in hexameters
or pentameters, if you would leave him in ignorance
of the value of a pennypiece? What height of stupidity it
is to be fillin’ a boy’s brains with the wisdom of the ancients,
and then turn him out like an <i>omadhaum</i>, to pick up his
victuals among the moderns!”</p>

<p class='c021'>With equal truth, but finer humour, has Sydney Smith,
at his own expense, exposed this neglect of the practical as
a fair indication of the mode of English education. He is
writing to his publisher, whom he tells: “I have twice endeavoured
to write the word <i>skipping</i>—‘<i>skipping spirit</i>.’ Your
printer first printed it ’stripling,’ and then altered it into
<i>stripping</i>. The fault is entirely mine. I was fifteen years
at school and college—I know something about the Romans
and the Athenians, and have read a good deal about the
præter-perfect tense—but I cannot do a sum in simple addition,
or <i>write a handwriting which any body can read</i>.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>“CRAMMING.”</h3>

<p class='c023'>Cramming, which in our time was a cant term in the
Universities for the art of preparing a student to pass an
examination by furnishing him beforehand with the requisite
answers, has travelled far beyond the tether of Oxford
or Cambridge. Its abuse is well described by Watts: “As
a man may be eating all day, and for want of digestion is
never nourished, so these endless readers may cram themselves
in vain with intellectual food.” It reminds one also
of the Baconian saw—of those who can pack the cards, yet
know not how to play them.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>A president Examiner of articled clerks at the Law Institution
has observed upon this forcing system:</p>

<p class='c028'>I for one, and I am glad of the opportunity of expressing it, abhor
all Cramming; and I hold very cheaply the system of Competitive Examination,
which is nowadays begun almost in the nursery, and thought
so highly of in some quarters as a test. It is not to be expected, without
inverting the natural order of things, that a youth of twenty or
twenty-one should have exhausted those stores of learning which Coke
speaks of as requiring not less than the <i>lucubrationes viginti annorum</i>;
and remember that those twenty years would begin at that
period of life on which most of you are now but entering. In this view
the papers before you have been prepared, and our aim as examiners
has been to set such questions as will prove you to possess the elements
of a liberal education; and that you have so far acquired the principles
of common law, equity, conveyancing, criminal law, and bankruptcy,
that you are entitled to enter upon the practice of your profession,
leaving its complete mastery to that experience which time alone can
supply. I need not remind you of the men who, beginning as attorneys,
have attained to high positions in the State. The portrait of Lord
Chancellor Truro hangs before you on these walls. I had the privilege
of knowing him personally; his example may well stimulate your ambition,
and animate your exertions, for never man won high place with
more unremitting labour than he did; not, however, at the expense of
his childhood or of his youth, not by the sacrifice of all else for mere
mental culture, but by the full-grown energies, by the well-directed
vigour and power of the man, for he was between thirty and forty years
of age before he was called to the bar.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>MATHEMATICS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Mathematics drew from Edmund Gurney the odd definition,
that “a mathematician is like one that goes to market
to buy an axe to break an egg.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Bacon complains that men do not sufficiently understand
the excellent use of the Pure Mathematics, in that
they do remedy and cure many defects in the wit and faculties
intellectual. For if the wit be too dull, they sharpen
it; if too wandering, they fix it; if too inherent in the
sense, they abstract it. So that as tennis is a game of no
use in itself, but of great use in respect it maketh a quick
eye, and a body ready to put itself into any postures; so in
the mathematics, that use which is collateral and intervenient
is no less worthy than that which is principal and
intended. And as for the Mixed Mathematics, I only make
this prediction, that there cannot fail to be more kinds of
them, as nature grows further disclosed;” thus foretelling
the advance of Natural Philosophy.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>However, the understanding of Applied Mathematics is
not unattainable under ordinary circumstances. Lord Rosse
has observed that, without any special mathematical knowledge,
a well-informed man may often, in the results announced,
and from the observations elicited, obtain very
interesting glimpses of the nature of mathematical processes,
and some general idea as to the progress making in
that direction. In applied mathematics there is much more
of general interest, and the results are often perfectly intelligible
without special education. In proof of this Lord
Rosse adduces, that “at the meeting of the British Association
at Oxford, the general results of a very abstruse investigation
in applied mathematics in physical astronomy were
made very interesting. The subject was so brought forward
as to rivet the attention of the whole section, and there
were many ladies present. The paper was given in by M.
Leverrier, and the subject was the identification of a comet.
How wonderful from its origin has been the progress of
mathematical science! Beginning perhaps three thousand
years ago almost from nothing—one simple relation of magnitude
suggesting another, and those relations gradually
becoming more complicated, more interesting, I may add
more important, till at length in our day it has expanded
into a science which enables us to <i>weigh the planets</i>, and,
more wonderful still, to calculate the course they will take
when acted continually upon by forces varying in magnitude
and direction.”</p>

<p class='c021'>We trace in Porson’s habits of thought the influence
which the study of mathematics had upon him.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c025'><sup>[76]</sup></a> He was to
his dying day fond of these studies. There are still preserved
many papers of his scribbled over with mathematical
calculations; and when the fit seized him in the street
which caused his death, an equation was found in his
pocket.</p>

<hr class='c027' />
<h3 class='c012'>ARISTOTLE.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Aristotle’s Philosophy, from its being upheld by the
Roman Catholic theology, was lowered in a corresponding
degree by the Reformation. Hence it fell into undeserved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>neglect during the latter part of the seventeenth and the
whole of the eighteenth century. Of late years, however,
the true worth of his writings has been more fully appreciated,
and the study of his best treatises has been much revived.
Dr. Holland remarks: “The whole of Aristotle’s
writings on Sleep, and other collateral topics, deserve much
more frequent perusal than is given to them in the present
day.” The geological theory of Lyell, viz. that the causes
which produce geological phenomena are in constant and
gradual operation, is the theory of Aristotle and John Ray
brought down to our present state of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c021'>It has been well said that Solomon, Aristotle, and Bacon
are the only three men, since our race appeared on earth,
who would have been justified in saying that “they took all
knowledge for their province.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>GEOLOGY IN EDUCATION.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The genius of Werner, of De Saussure, and of Cuvier,
laid the foundations on which Geology now rests. They
gave us the first glimpse of the fauna and flora of the earlier
ages of our planet. Professor Jameson soon saw that these
investigations would also lead to much curious information
in regard to the former physical and geographical distribution
of plants and animals; and to the changes which the
animated world in general, and particular genera and species,
have undergone, and probably are still undergoing;
and he would naturally be led to speculate on the changes
that must have taken place in the climate of the globe during
these various changes and revolutions. The writings of
Blumenbach, Von Hoff, Cuvier, Brongniart, Steffens, and
other naturalists, are proofs of what has been done by following
up the views of Werner. Ami Boué, speaking of the
services Professor Jameson has rendered to science, says:
“He has spread valuable working pupils all over the
world, and he was the electric spark which originated the
beginning of true geology in Great Britain.”</p>

<p class='c028'>It is not much more than seventy years since Bishop Watson, a man
of no mean abilities and of no slight distinction, turned the science of
geology into open ridicule. He said that the geologists who attempted
to speculate on the internal formation of the globe reminded him only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>of a gnat which might be perched upon the shoulders of an elephant,
and might, by the reach of its tiny puncture, affect to tell him what
was the whole internal structure of the majestic animal below.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c025'><sup>[77]</sup></a> Listen
now to the language of an eminent man of the present day, Sir David
Brewster, on the same great subject: “How interesting must it be to
study such phenomena—to escape for a while from the works of man—to
go back to primeval times, and learn how its Maker moulded the
earth—how He wore down the primitive mass into the strata of its
present surface—how He deposited the precious metals in its bowels—how
He filled it with races of living animals, and again buried them in
its depths, to chronicle the steps of creative power—how He covered
its surface with its fruit-bearing soil, and spread out the waters of the
deep as the great highway of nations, to unite into one brotherhood
the different races of his creatures, and to bless them by the interchange
of their produce and their affections!” And again, referring to
the discoveries of the great Cuvier in connexion with geology, he says:
“In thus deciphering the handwriting of nature on her tablets of stone,
the same distinguished naturalist discovered that all organised beings
were not created at the same period. In the commissariat of Providence
the stores were provided before the arrival of the host that was
to devour them. Plants were created before animals, the molluscous
fishes next appeared, then the reptiles, and last of all the mammiferous
quadrupeds completed the scale of animal life.” Such are the terms in
which able men now refer to geological science.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c025'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c023'>Fortunately, the science of Geology is an eminently
popular one. The arguments which go to establish its
leading doctrines require no long course of previous study
to make them intelligible, and its professors, in this country
at least, have been no way disposed to confine their teaching
to the sanctuaries of learning. Wherever an audience
can be gathered together, some eminent geologist is always
ready to discourse for the benefit of the gentiles of science,
who have rewarded their instructors by a larger share of
popularity than is generally bestowed on the professors of
other branches of physical knowledge. The consequence
is, that a smattering of Geology is now very generally diffused
amongst the upper and middle classes in this country—an
excellent thing in itself, since even a smattering of
natural science helps to enlarge and elevate the mind, but
sometimes inconvenient, because few learn enough to get a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>correct idea of the extent of their own ignorance as compared
with the smallness of their knowledge. In the interest
of science, the main point to be gained is that, out of
the large number who approach the threshold, a sufficient
number should be induced to enter into her service, and
that each of these should find work fit for his strength and
his special faculties. Measured in this way, the progress of
Geology seems to be sufficiently satisfactory.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c025'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f77'>
<p class='c021'><a href='#r77'>77</a>. Mr. Watson, among other qualities, which certainly contributed to his
advancement in life, possessed a happy confidence in himself, and an opinion of
his own fitness for any situation to which he should think proper to aspire,
though totally destitute at the time of every qualification requisite to the discharge
of its functions. On the 19th of November 1764, he informs us, “I was
unanimously elected by the Senate, assembled in full congregation, Professor of
Chemistry. At the time this honour was conferred upon me <i>I knew nothing at all
of chemistry</i>; had never read a syllable on the subject, nor seen a single experiment
in it.”—<i>Quarterly Review</i>, vol. xviii. p. 233.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE BEST EDUCATION.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Philip de Mornay enjoins: “The best thing to be instilled
into the minds of children, is to fear God. This is
the beginning, the middle, and the end, of wisdom. Next,
they ought to be induced to be kind one to another. Great
care ought to be taken to guard against speaking on improper
subjects in their presence, since lasting impressions
are made at a very early age; on the contrary, our conversation
ought to be on good and instructive topics. Imperceptibly
to themselves or others, they derive great benefit
from such discourse; for it is quite certain that children
take the tinge either of good or evil, without the process
being discovered.”</p>

<p class='c021'>True excellence is only to be arrived at by the true
Education; for in Education, as in all the rest of life, there
are two ways of acting. “The one way, when the learner
looks upon his powers as his own, and works them in
a self-confident, hard spirit; which is by far the quickest
way to temporary success. The other, when the learner,
looking upon all his powers as given to him, works humbly
in a tentative spirit, distrusting self, keeping the heart open
to improvement, thinking that every body and every thing
can teach him something; putting himself, in fact, in God’s
hand, as a learner, not as a judge. To such a spirit belongs
the promise that he shall be led into all truth. Directly
we imagine we know a thing, we close our stores, and
shut the gates against fresh treasures; but whilst laying
up truth, still think that all is incomplete, still humbly
think, however broad and firm and deep the foundation we
have laid may be, that eternity shall not suffice for the superstructure;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>in fact, still hold the vessel to be filled, and
God will ever fill it; still use that fulness in His service,
and at the right time the right thing shall come. Nothing
but pride shuts out knowledge. Who is not conscious,
taking only the merest intellectual work, how little really
depends on himself, how many thoughts are direct gifts, how
much precious material <i>comes</i> into his hands, is given—is
given—not his own; who will not admit, if nothing more,
that a headache, a qualm, may destroy his cherished hopes,
so little can he rely on self?”<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c025'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>The late Baron Alderson, writing to his son, says: “I
have sent you to Eton that you may be taught your duties
as an English young gentleman. The first duty of such a
person is to be a good and religious Christian; the next is
to be a good scholar; and the third is to be accomplished in
all manly exercises and games, such as rowing, swimming,
jumping, cricket, and the like. Most boys, I fear, begin at
the wrong end, and take the last first; and, what is still
worse, never arrive at either of the other two at all. I hope,
however, better things of you; and to hear first that you
are a good, truthful, honest boy, and then that you are one
of the hardest workers in your class; and after that, I confess
I shall be by no means sorry to hear that you can show
the idle boys that an industrious one can be a good cricketer,
and jump as wide a ditch, or clear as high a hedge, as
any of them.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ADVICE TO THE STUDENT.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Dr. Arnold has given this sound counsel: “Preserve proportion
in your reading, keep your view of men and things
extensive, and, <i>depend upon it, a mixed knowledge is not a superficial
one;</i> as far as it goes, the views that it gives are
true; but he who reads deeply in one class of writers only,
gets views which are almost sure to be perverted, and which
are not only narrow but false.”</p>

<p class='c021'>It is a great mistake to suppose that full employment
shuts out leisure. The secret of leisure is to have eight
hours a day entirely devoted to business, and you will then
find you have time for other pursuits; this for some time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>to come will seem to you a paradox; but you will one day
be convinced of the truth, that the man who is the most
engaged has always the most leisure.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM.</h3>

<p class='c023'>That Knowledge is not True Wisdom cannot be too
strongly urged upon youth. “There is a heaping up of
knowledge just as amenable to this censure as the ignorance
of the unlearned, not indeed so censured by man, but
equally worthy of it in a true judgment. The intellectual
fool, full of knowledge but without wisdom, whose way is
right in his own eyes, is no less a fool, nay, more so, than
the ignorant fool, and as far from true wisdom. For knowledge
is a very different thing from wisdom; knowledge is
but the collecting together of a mass of material at best,
whilst wisdom is the right perception and right use leading
to further riches. The mere heaper-up of knowledge digs,
as it were, ore out of the earth, working underground in
darkness; whereas the wise man fashions all his knowledge
into use and beauty, praising and blessing God with it, and
receiving from Him a fuller measure in consequence. Wisdom
is knowledge applied to life and to the praise of God,—a
thing of the heart, the heart controlling and using all the
head gathers; knowledge by itself is a mere barren store of
the head, quite separable from goodness and love,—a thing
capable of being possessed by devils. For this we must
mark, the humblest good heart which loves God alone can
attain to the knowledge of God. No mere intellectual power
and pride can do that. And hence we may see why the man
whose way is right in his own eyes is a fool.”<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c025'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Montaigne thus points out an educational error, common
in our time as well as in that of this charming writer, whom
a gentleman is ashamed not to have read:</p>

<p class='c028'>The care and expense our parents are at have no other aim but to
furnish our heads with knowledge, but not a word of judgment and virtue.
Cry out of one that passes by to our people, “Oh, what a learned
man is that!” and of another, “Oh, what a good man is that!” they
will not fail to turn their eyes and pay their respects to the former.
There should then be a third man to cry out, “Oh, what blockheads they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>are!” Men are ready to ask, “Does he understand Greek or Latin—is
he a poet or prose-writer?” But whether he is the better or more
discreet man, though it is the main question, is the last; for the inquiry
should be, who has the best learning, not who has the most. We
only take pains to stuff the memory, and leave the understanding and
conscience quite unfurnished. Of what service is it to us to have a
bellyful of meat, if it does not digest—if it does not change its form
in our bodies—and if it does not nourish and strengthen us? We suffer
ourselves to lean so much upon the arms of others, that our strength is
of no use to us. Would I fortify myself against the fear of death, I do
it at the expense of Seneca; would I extract consolation for myself
or my friend, I borrow it from Cicero; whereas I might have found
it in myself, if I had been trained up in the exercise of my own reason.
I do not fancy the acquiescence in second-hand hearsay knowledge; for
though we may be learned by the help of another’s knowledge, we
can never be wise but by our own wisdom. Agesilaus being asked what
he thought most proper for boys to learn, replied: What they ought
to do when they come to be men.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>EDUCATION ALARMISTS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>That a little learning is a dangerous thing, is an old saying,
which has been fearfully repeated in these days; but
a little learning every one will have, and the only way of
averting the danger is, by providing the people with all
facilities for acquiring more.</p>

<p class='c021'>Lord Stowell was no admirer of the prevailing rage for
universal education, and made a remark with which Lord
Sidmouth was much struck: “If you provide,” he said,
“a larger amount of cultivated talent than there is a demand
for, the surplus is very likely to turn sour.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Sir John Coleridge, in expressing his high sense of the
obligations of the country to the University of Oxford for
their recent aids to Middle-Class Education, says: “If the
lower orders are to be raised in political power in this country,
to make that a blessing you must cultivate the lower
orders for discharging the duties to be thrown upon them.
Therefore it is that I think the University of Oxford conferred
the largest benefit that it had in its power to confer
upon this country at large, when, passing simply from the
education of the higher orders and those who were destined
for the Church, it spread out its hands in a frank and liberal
spirit to all classes of society, and offered to connect every
body with itself, in a certain measure, who would only fit
himself for it by proper application.”</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>YORKSHIRE SCHOOLS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The disappearance from our newspapers of strings of
“Education” advertisements of Schools with low tariffs in
Yorkshire, shows the effect of satiric humour in correcting
abuses of our own time. The dietary of a school in Yorkshire,
barmecide breakfasts and dinners, was often held up
<i>in terrorem</i> to refractory boys, who heard the threat of “I’ll
send you to Yorkshire,” with fear and trembling. Mr. Dickens
gives an admirable exposure of this Spartan system in his
tale of <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i>, in the preface to which he says:</p>

<p class='c028'>I cannot call to mind now how I came to hear about Yorkshire
schools, when I was not a very robust child, sitting in bye places, near
Rochester Castle, with a head full of Partridge, Strap, Tom Pipes, and
Sancho Panza; but I know that my first impressions of them were
picked up at that time, and that they were, somehow or other, connected
with a suppurated abscess that some boy had come home with
in consequence of his Yorkshire guide, philosopher, and friend having
ripped it open with an inky penknife.</p>

<p class='c023'>Before the book was written, Mr. Dickens went into Yorkshire
to look for a school in which the imaginary boy of an
imaginary widow might be put away until the thawing of a
tardy compassion in that widow’s imaginary friends. Then
some stern realities were seen; and we are told also, in the
preface, of a supper with a real John Browdie, whose answer
as to the search for a cheap Yorkshire schoolmaster was,
“Dom’d if ar can gang to bed and not tellee, for weedur’s
sak’, to keep the lattle boy from a’ sike scoundrels, while
there’s a harse to hoold in a’ London, or a goother to lie
asleep in!”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Great mistakes have been made in writing books for
children. When Sir Walter Scott was about to write his
<i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>, he remarked: “I am persuaded both
children and the lower class of readers hate books which
are written <i>down</i> to their capacity, and love those that are
composed for their elders and betters. I will make, if possible,
a book that a child shall understand, yet a man should
feel some temptation to peruse should he chance to take it
up.... The grand and interesting consists in ideas, not
in words.” Again, “the problem of narrating history is at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>once to excite and gratify the curiosity of youth, and please
and instruct the wisest of mature minds.”<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c025'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The treasures of our tongue, says Dr. Richardson, the
lexicographer, are spread over continents, and cultivated
among islands in the northern and the southern hemisphere,
from “the unformed Occident to the strange shores of unknowing
nations in the East.” The sun, indeed, now never
sets upon the empire of Great Britain. Not one hour of
the twenty-four in which the earth completes her diurnal
revolution, not one round of the minute-hand of the dial,
is allowed to pass, in which, on some portion of the surface
of the globe, the air is not filled with “accents that are
ours.” They are heard in the ordinary transactions of life,
or in the administration of law, or in the deliberations of
the senate-house or council-chamber, or in the offices of
private devotion, or in the public observance of the rites
and duties of a common faith.</p>

<p class='c021'>Dr. Richardson’s <i>Dictionary of the English Language</i>, the
foremost work of its class, we owe greatly to the judicious
energy of Mr. Pickering, the publisher, who laid out two
thousand pounds in books, specially for this great labour,
before it was commenced. If publishers would imitate Mr.
Pickering’s liberality oftener than is done, there would be
fewer incomplete and abortive compilations than are yearly
issued from the press. Dr. Richardson acknowledges this
valuable aid in his Preface, where he justly makes his boast
of bringing within the circle of his reading a large number
of books which had never been employed for lexicographical
purposes before; and Dean Trench acknowledges that the
virgin soil which Richardson has tilled has often yielded
him large and rich returns.</p>

<p class='c021'>Of the uselessness of our legions of words to be found in
dictionaries, a writer of the day observes:</p>

<p class='c028'>Dictionary English is something very different not only from common
colloquial English, but even from that of ordinary written composition.
Instead of about 40,000 words, there is probably no single author
in the language from whose works, however voluminous, so many
as 10,000 words could be collected. Of the 40,000 words there are certainly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>many more than one-half that are only employed, if they are ever
employed at all, on the rarest occasions. We should any of us be surprised
to find, if we counted them, with how small a number of words we
manage to express all that we have to say either with our lips or even
with the pen. Our common literary English probably hardly extends to
10,000 words, our common spoken English hardly to 5000. And the
proportion of native or home-grown words is undoubtedly very much
higher in both the 5000 and the 10,000 than it is in the 40,000. Perhaps
of the 30,000 words, or thereabouts, standing in the dictionaries, that
are very rarely or never used, even in writing, between 20,000 and
25,000 may be free of French or Latin extraction. If we assume 22,500
to be so, that will leave 5000 Teutonic words in common use; and in
our literary English, taken at 10,000 words, those that are non-Roman
will thus amount to about one-half. Of that half 4000 words may be
current in our spoken language, which will therefore be genuine English
for four-fifths of its entire extent. It will consist of about 4000 Gothic
and 1000 Roman words.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c025'><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c023'>The Rev. Dr. D’Orsey has shown, by coloured charts and
elaborate tables, the proportion of the Teutonic and Romanic
elements in the spoken language of England, and in
the writings of our great authors. Thus, out of 100,000
words, at least 60,000 were Teutonic, 30,000 Romanic, and
10,000 from all other sources.</p>

<p class='c021'>It would be almost impossible to compose a sentence of
moderate length consisting solely of words of Latin derivation.
But there are many which can be rendered wholly in
Anglo-Saxon. It would be easy to make the Lord’s Prayer
entirely, as it is in present use almost entirely, Anglo-Saxon.
It consists of sixty words, and six of these only have a Latin
root. But for each of them, except one, we have an exact
Saxon equivalent. For “trespasses” we may substitute
“sins;” for “temptation,” “trials;” for “deliver,” “free;”
and for “power,” “might.” Dr. Trench proposes for “glory,”
“brightness;” but this we think is not a good substitute.</p>

<p class='c021'>The gradual changes in language are very remarkable.
Dean Trench, in one of his popular manuals, observes:
“How few aged persons, let them retain the fullest possession
of their faculties, are conscious of any difference between
the spoken language of their early youth and that
of their old age; that words, and ways of using words, are
obsolete now which were usual then; that many words
are current now which had no existence at that time. And
yet it is certain that so it must be. A man may fairly
be supposed to remember clearly and well for sixty years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>back; and it needs less than five of these sixties to bring
us to the period of Spenser, and not more than eight to set
us in the time of Chaucer and Wiclif. How great a change,
how vast a difference in our language, within eight memories!
No one, overlooking this whole term, will deny the
greatness of the change. For all this, we may be tolerably
sure that, had it been possible to interrogate a series of eight
persons, such as together had filled up this time, intelligent
men, but men whose attention had not been especially
roused on this subject, each in his turn would have denied
that there had been any change at all during his lifetime.
And yet, having regard to the multitude of words which
have fallen into disuse during these four or five hundred
years, we are sure that there must have been some lives in
this chain which saw those words in use at their commencement,
and out of use before their close. And so, too, of the
multitude of words which have come into being within the
limits of each of these lives.”</p>

<hr class='c027' />
<h3 class='c012'>WHAT IS “ARGUMENT”?</h3>

<p class='c023'>The origin and proper value of the word “Argument” has
been thus explained by the Rev. Dr. Donaldson, in a paper
read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society:</p>

<p class='c021'>The author first investigated the etymology and meaning
of the Latin verb <i>arguo</i>, and its participle <i>argutus</i>. He
showed that <i>arguo</i> was a corruption of <i>argruo</i> = <i>ad gruo</i>;
that <i>gruo</i> (in <i>argruo</i>, <i>ingruo</i>, <i>congruo</i>) ought to be compared
with κρούω, which means “to dash one thing against another,”
especially for the purpose of making a shrill, ringing
noise; that <i>arguo</i> means “to knock something for the purpose
of making it ring, or testing its soundness,” hence “to
test, examine, and prove any thing;” and that <i>argutus</i> signifies
“made to ring,” hence “making a distinct, shrill
noise,” or “tested and put to the proof.” Accordingly <i>argumentum</i>
means <i>id quod arguit</i>, “that which makes a substance
ring, which sounds, examines, tests, and proves it.”</p>

<p class='c021'>It was then shown that these meanings were not only
borne out by the classical usage of the word, but also by the
technical application of “argument” as a logical term. For
it is not equivalent to “argumentation,” or the process of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>reasoning; it does not even denote a complete syllogism;
though Dr. Whately and some other writers on logic had
fallen into this vague use of the word, and though it was so
understood in the disputations of the Cambridge schools.
The proper use of the word “argument” in logic is to denote
“the middle term,” <i>i. e.</i> “the term used for proof.” In a
sense similar to this the word is employed by mathematicians;
and there can be no doubt that the oldest and best
logicians confine the word to this, which is still its most
common signification.</p>

<p class='c021'>The author shows, by a collection of examples from the
best English poets, that the established meanings of the
word “argument” are reducible to three: (1) a proof, or
means of proving; (2) a process of reasoning, or controversy,
made up of such proofs; (3) the subject-matter of any discourse,
writing, or picture. He maintains that the second of
these meanings should be excluded from scientific language.</p>

<p class='c021'>By this we are reminded of Swift’s dictum, of much
wider application—that “Argument, as generally managed,
is the worst sort of conversation; as it is generally in books
the worst sort of reading.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'>HANDWRITING.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The characters of writing have followed the genius of
the barbarous ages: they are well or ill formed, in proportion
as the sciences have flourished more or less. Antiquaries
remark that the medals struck during the consulship
of Fabius Pictor, 250 years before Augustus, have the letters
better formed than those of the older date. Those of the
time of Augustus, and the following age, show characters
of perfect beauty. Those of Diocletian and Maximian are
worse formed than those of the Antonines; and again, those
of the Justins and Justinians degenerate into a Gothic taste.
But it is not to medals only that these remarks are applicable:
we see the same inferiority of written characters
generally following in the train of barbarism and ignorance.
During the first race of the French kings, we find no writing
which is not a mixture of Roman and other characters.
Under the empire of Charlemagne and of Louis le Débonnaire,
the characters returned almost to the same point of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>perfection which distinguished them in the time of Augustus,
but in the following age there was a relapse to the former
barbarism; so that for four or five centuries we find only the
Gothic characters in manuscripts; for it is not worth while
making an exception for short periods which were somewhat
more polished, and when there was less inelegance in
the formation of the letters.</p>

<p class='c021'>The being <i>able to write</i> has been taken by our statists
as the best evidence of the progress of education. Thus,
twenty years ago, only 67 in every 100 men who married in
England signed their names upon the register, and 51 in
every 100 women, and thirteen years later the percentage was
but 69·6 of the men and 56·1 of the women; but in the last
seven years, a period which probably shows in its marriages
the result chiefly of the education of the years 1840-45 or
thereabouts, the advance has been much greater, and the
Registrar-General reports that in 1860 the proportion of
men writing their names had risen to 74·5, and of women to
63·8. In the whole twenty years the proportion of men who
write has risen from being only two-thirds to be three-fourths,
and of women from being a half to be nearly two-thirds,
which may be expressed with tolerable accuracy by
saying that where four persons had to “make their mark”
then, only three do so now. This is for all England; but
the rate of progress has not been the same in every part of
the kingdom.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the reign of George III., when education had become
more general, the crosses of those who could not write
lost the distinction and artistic character of older times,
and the large bold round-hand corresponds in style with
the buildings and furniture then in use. This writing,
although without much beauty, has, notwithstanding, the
merit of distinctness. In these railway times, with the exception
of book-keepers in banks and clerks in merchants’
offices, few seem to have time to trim their letters. Few
artists write a good hand. Physicians’ prescriptions are
often as difficult to decipher as ancient hieroglyphics; and
it must be confessed that writers for the press are not generally
remarkable for either the distinctness or beauty of
their manuscript. As regards artists, the practice of handling
the brush and pencil is not favourable to graceful penmanship;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>and in respect of the literary profession, it is
generally difficult for the pen to keep pace with the thoughts,
to say nothing of the fact, that time often presses.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c025'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Short-Hand is of great antiquity; for Seneca tells us that
in his time reporting had been carried to such perfection,
that a writer could keep pace in his report with the most
rapid speaker.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ENGLISH STYLE.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Style in writing has been well defined by Swift as “proper
words in proper places.” However, this is rarely seen.</p>

<p class='c021'>To the unsettled state of our language, and owing to the
want of proper training in composition, may be attributed
the general corruption of English Style, which has scarcely
ceased since Southey, in his <i>Colloquies</i>, wrote the following
vigorous condemnation of it:</p>

<p class='c028'>More lasting effect was produced by translators, who, in later times,
have corrupted our idiom as much as, in early ones, they enriched our
vocabulary; and to this injury the Scotch have greatly contributed;
for, composing in a language which is not their mother tongue, they
necessarily acquired an artificial and formal style, which, not so much
through the merit of a few, as owing to the perseverance of others, who
for half a century seated themselves on the bench of criticism, has almost
superseded the vernacular English of Addison and Swift. Our
journals, indeed, have been the great corrupters of our style, and continue
to be so; and not for this reason only. Men who write in newspapers,
and magazines, and reviews, write for present effect; in most
cases, this is as much their natural and proper aim, as it would be in
public speaking; but when it is so, they consider, like public speakers,
not so much what is accurate or just, either in matter or manner, as
what will be acceptable to those whom they address. Writing also
under the excitement of emulation and rivalry, they seek, by all the
artifices and efforts of an ambitious style, to dazzle their readers; and
they are wise in their generation, experience having shown that common
minds are taken by glittering faults, both in prose and verse, as
larks are with looking-glasses.</p>

<p class='c041'>In this school it is that most writers are now trained; and after
such training, any thing like an easy and natural movement is as little
to be looked for in their compositions as in the step of a dancing-master.
To the views of style, which are thus generated, there must be
added the inaccuracies inevitably arising from haste, when a certain
quantity of matter is to be supplied for a daily or weekly publication,
which allows of no delay,—the slovenliness that confidence as well as
fatigue and inattention will produce,—and the barbarisms which are
the effect of ignorance, or that smattering of knowledge which serves
only to render ignorance presumptuous. These are the causes of corruption
in our current style; and when these are considered, there
would be ground for apprehending that the best writings of the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>century might become as obsolete as ours in the like process of time,
if we had not in our Liturgy and our Bible a standard from which it
will not be possible wholly to depart.</p>

<p class='c023'>The days of sentences of one word, and of others without
a verb, had not then arrived; nor had the spasmodic
and sensation style been introduced. Southey’s own style,
whether for narrative, for exposition, or for animated argumentation,
was perhaps the most effective English style of
the time. It combines in a remarkable degree a somewhat
lofty dignity with ease and idiomatic vigour. He was the
most hard-working writer of his time, and left about 12,000<i>l.</i>
in money, besides a valuable library.</p>

<p class='c021'>Sir Thomas Browne satirises the strenuous advocacy of
the classical style by saying: “We are now forced to study
Latin, in order to understand English.” And Pope ridicules
that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>Easy Ciceronian style,</div>
      <div class='line'>So Latin, yet so English all the while.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>It is no paradox to say that the perfection of style is to
have none, but to let the words be suggested by the sentiments,
unchecked by the monotony of a manner, and untainted
by affectation.</p>

<p class='c021'>How striking is this short passage in a speech of Edward
IV. to his Parliament! “The injuries that I have
received are known every where, and the eyes of the world
are fixed upon me to see with what countenance I suffer.”
If actual events could often be related in this way, there
would be more books in circulating libraries than romances
and novels.</p>

<p class='c021'>This lively and graphic style is plainly the best, though
now and then the historian’s criticism is wanted to support
a startling fact, or to explain a confused transaction. Thus,
the learned Rudbeck, in his <i>Atlantica</i>, four volumes folio,
ascribing an ancient temple in Sweden to one of Noah’s
sons, warily adds, “’Twas probably the youngest.”</p>

<p class='c021'>A more practical definition of style may be gathered from
what Fox said of his great antagonist, Pitt,—and therefore
the more to be trusted,—that he always used <i>the</i> word; and
each word had its own place, not regulated by chance, but
by law.</p>

<p class='c021'>To write a good Letter is a rare accomplishment. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>owing to the want of proper training in the laws of composition
that so few persons in England can write even a
common letter correctly. We will give a familiar instance
of a very frequent solecism which occurs in one of the most
common acts of every-day life—the answer to a dinner invitation;
and it is one in which, we are sorry to say, well-educated
ladies are too often caught tripping. When “Mr.
A. and Mrs. A. request the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs. B.’s
company at dinner,” the reply usually is, “Mr. and Mrs. B.
<i>will</i> have the pleasure of accepting” the invitation. But the
acceptance is already <i>un fait accompli</i> by the very act of
writing it,—it is a present, not a future event; and the
answer of course ought to be either “Mr. and Mrs. B. <i>have</i>
the pleasure of accepting,” or “Mr. and Mrs. B. <i>will have</i>
the pleasure of <i>dining</i>.”<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c025'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>ART OF WRITING.</h3>

<p class='c023'>“He that would write well,” says Roger Ascham, “must
follow the advice of Aristotle, to speak as the common people
speak, and to think as the wise think.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Coleridge says: “To write or talk concerning any subject,
without having previously taken the pains to understand
it, is a breach of the duty which we owe to ourselves,
though it may be no offence against the law of the land.
The privilege of talking, and even publishing, nonsense, is
necessary in a free state; but the more sparingly we make
use of it, the better.”<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c025'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Much reading and good company are supposed to be the
best methods of getting at the niceties and elegancies of a
language; but this road is long and irksome. The great
point is to acquire our most usual Anglicisms; all those
phrases and peculiarities which form the characteristics of
our language. Nearly eighty years since, Mr. Sharp took
upon himself to say that we had no grammar capable of
teaching a foreigner to read our authors; adding, “but of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>this I am sure, that we have none by which he can be enabled
to understand our conversation.”</p>

<p class='c021'>What an annoyance are long speakers, long talkers, and
long writers—people who will not take time to think, or are
not capable of thinking accurately! Once when Dr. South
had preached before Queen Anne, her majesty observed to
him, “You have given me a most excellent discourse, Dr.
South; but I wish you had had time to make it longer.”
“Nay, madam,” replied the doctor, “if I had had time, I
should have made it shorter.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Method in treating your subject is of great importance.
Southey has well illustrated the absence of this quality.
A Quaker, by name Benjamin Lay (who was a little cracked
in the head, though sound at the heart), took one of his
compositions to Benjamin Franklin, that it might be printed
and published. Franklin, having looked over the manuscript,
observed that it was deficient in arrangement: “It
is no matter,” replied the author; “print any part thou
pleaseth first.” Many are the speeches, and the sermons,
and the treatises, and the poems, and the volumes, which
are like Benjamin Lay’s book: the head might serve for the
tail, and the tail for the body, and the body for the head;
either end for the middle, and the middle for either end;
nay, if you could turn them inside out, like a polypus or a
glove, they would be no worse for the operation.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c025'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Free Translation is a rare accomplishment. Sir John
Denham, who is declared by Johnson “to have been one
of the first that understood the necessity of emancipating
translation from the drudgery of counting lines and interpreting
single words,” gives the same praise to Sir Richard
Fanshawe, whom he addresses thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>That servile path thou nobly dost decline,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of tracing word by word and line by line;</div>
      <div class='line'>A new and nobler way thou dost pursue,</div>
      <div class='line'>To make translations and translators too:</div>
      <div class='line'>They but preserve the ashes, thou the flame,</div>
      <div class='line'>True to his sense, but truer to his fame.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Dryden said, all the translations of the old school “want
to be translated into English;” and verbal translation he
compares to “dancing on ropes with fettered legs.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Education cannot do all that Helvetius supposes, but
it can do much. <i>Elle fait danser l’ours</i>,—It makes a bear
dance. It is said that some insects take the colour of the
leaf that they feed upon. “I was common clay till roses
were planted in me,” says some aromatic earth, in an eastern
fable.</p>

<p class='c021'>To unlearn is harder than to learn, and the Grecian
flute-player was right in requiring double fees from those
pupils who had been taught by another master. “I am
rubbing their father out of my children as fast as I can,”
said a clever widow of rank and fashion.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Education of princes, or indeed the spoilt children
of rich and distinguished parents, must be the <i>experimentum
crucis</i> of teaching. “If Fénelon did succeed, as it is recorded
he did, in educating the Dauphin, his success was
little less than a miracle. How can any man, though of
advanced age and of high reputation, perhaps also of a
sacred profession and of elevated station, be expected to
preserve any useful authority over a child (probably a wayward
little animal), if he, the tutor, must always address
the pupil by his title, or at least must never forget that he
is heir to a throne?”</p>

<p class='c021'>There is some truth in the following remarks by a writer
in <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i>, upon information overmuch:</p>

<p class='c028'>We deal largely in general knowledge—an excellent article, no
doubt; but one may have too much of it. Sometimes ignorance is
really bliss. It has not added to my personal comfort to know to a
decimal fraction what proportion of red earth I may expect to find in
my cocoa every morning; to have become knowingly conscious that
my coffee is mixed with ground liver and litmus, instead of honest
chicory; and that bisulphuret of mercury forms the basis of my cayenne.
It was once my fate to have a friend staying in my house who
was one of these minute philosophers. He used to amuse himself after
breakfast by a careful analysis and diagnosis of the contents of the teapot,
laid out as a kind of <i>hortus siccus</i> on his plate. “This leaf, now,”
he would say, “is fuchsia; observe the serrated edges: that’s no tea-leaf—positively
poisonous. This now, again, is blackthorn, or privet—yes,
privet; you may know it by the divisions in the panicles: that’s
no tea-leaf.” A most uncomfortable guest he was; and though not a
bad companion in many respects, I felt my appetite improved the first
time I sat down to dinner without him. It won’t do to look into all
your meals with a microscope. Of course there is a medium between
these over-curious investigations and an implicit faith in every thing
that is set before you.</p>

<p class='c021'><a href='#r86'>86</a>. <a id='bm'></a>One fine morning, a stalwart anti-Newtonian, properly accredited, presented

universe!). “I am happy to see you,” replied the Baron; “but before we commence,
I must ask you if you consider yourself proficient in mathematics?”
The anti-Newtonian was dumbfounded. “Then,” rejoined the Baron, “it would
be unprofitable for us to begin;” and he passed on to a more genial topic.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WANT OF A PURSUIT.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Such is the complicated constitution of human nature, that
a man without a predominant inclination is not likely to be
either useful or happy.</p>

<p class='c021'>He who is every thing is nothing, is as true of our sensitive
as of our intellectual nature. He is rather a bundle of
little likings, than a compact and energetic individual. A
strong desire soon subdues the weaker, and rules us with
the united force of all that it subjugates.</p>

<p class='c021'>Such being the force of human feelings, it must embitter
our daily lives if our employments are unsuited to our
talents and our wishes; yet how few, alas, are so fortunate
as to be gaining either wealth or fame while gratifying an
inclination!</p>

<p class='c021'>In the best of all arts, the art of living, the greatest skill
is not to wait; but, as you run along, snatch at every fruit
and every flower growing within your reach; for, after all
that can be said, youth, the age of hope and admiration,
and manhood, the age of business and of influence, are to
be preferred to the period of extinguished passions and
languid curiosity. At that season, our hopes and wishes
must have been too long dropping, leaf by leaf, away. The
last scenes of the fifth act are seldom the most interesting,
either in a tragedy or a comedy. Yet many compensations
arise as our sensibility decays:</p>

<p class='c021'>Life, without some necessity for exertion (says Mr.

<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>of the greatest enjoyment where necessity urges, but
not painfully; where effort is required, but as much as possible
without anxiety; where the spring and summer of
life are preparatory to the harvest of autumn and the repose
of winter. Then is every season sweet, and, in a well-spent
life, the last the best—the season of calm enjoyment,
the richest in recollections, the brightest in hope. Good
training and a fair start constitute a more desirable patrimony
than wealth; and those parents who study their children’s
welfare rather than the gratification of their own
avarice or vanity, would do well to think of this. Is it better
to run a successful race, or to begin and end at the goal?</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE ENGLISH CHARACTER.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Four and thirty years since, Sir Humphry Davy wrote:“The English as a nation are preëminently active, and the
natives of no other country follow their objects with so much
force, fire, and constancy. And as human powers are limited,
there are few examples of very distinguished men living in
this country to old age: they usually fail, droop, and die,
before they have attained the period naturally marked out
for the end of human existence. The lives of our statesmen,
warriors, poets, and even philosophers, offer abundant proofs
of the truth of this opinion: whatever burns, consumes;
ashes remain. Before the period of youth is passed, gray
hairs usually cover those brows which are adorned with the
civic oak or the laurel; and in the luxurious and exciting
life of the men of pleasure, their tints are not even preserved
by the myrtle wreath or the garland of roses from the premature
winter of time.” If these characteristics were applicable
to English life a third of a century since, how much
has their fitness been strengthened by the rapidity of action,
the excitement, and want of repose adding to the wear and
tear of existence, since that period.</p>

<p class='c021'>That the Englishman is one of the most noble species
of the genus to which he belongs, seems to be generally conceded.
The poet Southey expressed the opinion of more
thinkers than himself when he said that the Englishman is
the model or pattern man, at least of all the species at present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>existing. But even those who are most thoroughly
convinced of this must admit that he has his peculiarities—foremost
among which is his nationality; and one of the
most striking peculiarities of that nationality is pride. Another
potent element in the English character is its practical
worth,—this word “practical” being the shibboleth by which
we love to recognise ourselves; as the Greeks delighted to
picture themselves as more wise, the French as more polite,
than other nations.</p>

<p class='c021'>Our genius has a most real, concrete, and altogether
terrestrial tendency: there seems to be a considerable majority
of Sadducees among us, or, as Plato calls them, “uninitiated
persons, who believe in nothing but what they can
lay hold of with their hands. These men will make railways,
telegraphs, and tunnels, and build crystal palaces, and collect
mechanical products from the ends of the earth, and
exhibit in every possible shape and variety the sublime of
what is mechanical and material; but for the supersensual
ideas, they will have none of them.”<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c025'><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Nevertheless, if we look through the history of the world’s
genius, we shall find its greatest successes to lie in the
practical. Homer begged; Tasso begged in a different way;
Galileo was racked; De Witt assassinated,—and all for wishing
to improve their species. At the same time, Raffaelle,
Michel Angelo, Zeuxis, Apelles, Rubens, Reynolds, Titian,
Shakspeare, were rich and happy. Why? because with their
genius they combined practical prudence. This is the grand
secret of success.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WORTH OF ENERGY.</h3>

<p class='c023'>A man with knowledge but without energy is a home furnished
but not inhabited; a man with energy but no knowledge,
a house dwelt in but unfurnished.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Sharp<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c025'><sup>[91]</sup></a> counsels us: “Prefer a life of energy to a
life of inaction. There are always kind friends enough ready
to preach up caution and delay, &amp;c. Yet it is impossible to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>lay down any general rule of a prudential kind. Every one
must be judged of after a careful review of all its circumstances;
for if one, only one, be overlooked, the decision may
be injurious or fatal. Thus, there will ever be many conflicting
reasons for and against a spirit of enterprise and a
habit of caution.</p>

<p class='c021'>“Those who advise others to withstand the temptations
of hope will always appear to be wiser than they really are,
for how often can it be made certain that the rejected and
untried hazard would have been successful? Besides, those
who dissuade us from action have corrupt but powerful allies
in our indolence, irresolution, and cowardice. To despond
is very easy, but it requires works as well as faith to engage
successfully in a difficult undertaking.</p>

<p class='c021'>“There are, however, few difficulties that hold out against
real attacks: they fly, like the visible horizon, before those
who advance. A passionate desire and an unwearied will
can perform impossibilities, or what seem to be so to the
cold and the feeble. If we do but go on, some unseen path
will open among the hills.</p>

<p class='c021'>“We must not allow ourselves to be discouraged by the
apparent disproportion between the result of single efforts
and the magnitude of the obstacles to be encountered. Nothing
great or good is to be obtained without courage and
industry; but courage and industry must have sunk in
despair, and the world must have remained unornamented
and unimproved, if men had nicely compared the effect of
a single stroke of the chisel with the pyramid to be raised,
or of a single impression of the spade with the mountain to
be levelled.</p>

<hr class='c046' />

<p class='c021'>“Efforts, it must not be forgotten, are as indispensable
as desires. The globe is not to be circumnavigated by one
wind. ‘It is better to wear out than to rust,’ says Bishop
Cumberland. ‘There will be time enough for repose in the
grave,’ said Nicole to Pascal. In truth, the proper rest for
man is change of occupation.</p>

<p class='c021'>“The toils as well as risks of an active life are commonly
overrated, so much may be done by the diligent use of ordinary
opportunities; but they must not always be waited
for. We must not only strike the iron while it is hot, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>strike it till ‘it is made hot.’ Herschel, the great astronomer,
declares that 90 or 100 hours, clear enough for observation,
cannot be called an unproductive year.</p>

<p class='c021'>“The lazy, the dissipated, and the fearful, should patiently
see the active and the bold pass them in the course.
They must bring down their pretensions to the level of their
talents. Those who have not energy to work must learn to
be humble, and should not vainly hope to unite the incompatible
enjoyments of indolence and enterprise, of ambition
and self-indulgence.”</p>

<p class='c021'>These lines of fair encouragement are the advice of a man
of the world, but whose feelings had not become blunted by
his intercourse with the world: he was one of the most
cheerful, amiable, and happy beings it ever fell to our lot to
know; his joyous manner was the true index to his large
and sound heart.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>TEST OF GREATNESS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The true test of a great man (says Lord Brougham),—that
at least which must secure his place among the highest
order of great men,—is his having been in advance of his
age. This it is which decides whether or not he has carried
forward the grand plan of human improvement; has conformed
his views and adapted his conduct to the existing
circumstances of society, or changed those so as to better its
condition; has been one of the lights of the world, or only
reflected the borrowed rays of former luminaries, and sat in
the same shade with the rest of his generation at the same
twilight or the same dawn.</p>

<p class='c021'>Nature seldom invests great men with any outward signs,
from which their greatness may be known or foretold; and
yet (says Lord Dudley) I own I share fully in that curiosity
of the vulgar, which induces them to follow after and to
gaze eagerly upon the mere bodily presence of persons that
have raised themselves high above the common level.</p>

<p class='c021'>Almost all great men who have performed, or who are
destined to perform, great things, are sparing of words.
Their communing is with themselves rather than with
others. They feed upon their own thoughts, and in these
inward musings brace those intellectual and active energies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>the development of which constitutes the great character.
Napoleon became a babbler only when his fate was accomplished,
and his fortune was on the decline.</p>

<p class='c021'>Boyle has this pertinent reflection: “There is such a
kind of difference between vertue shaded by a private, and
shining forth in a publick life, as there is betwixt a candle
carri’d aloft in the open air, and inclosed in a lanthorn; in
the former place it gives more light, but in the latter ’tis
in less danger to be blown out.”<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c025'><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>The real test of greatness is courage and respect for
truth, generally the earliest precept of childhood, yet of
comparatively rare observance through life. “Without courage,”
says Sir Walter Scott, “there cannot be truth; and
without truth there can be no other virtue.” And how
nobly did Scott illustrate this in his own life-practice!</p>

<p class='c021'>Truth was the redeeming virtue of one of the favoured
men of our political history. The qualities which raised
Fox high as a party leader were not merely his eloquence,
his wit, his genius, but also his engaging warmth of heart
and kindliness of temper. To these a strong testimony may
be found in the memoirs of a great historian by no means
blind to his faults, and by no means attached to his principles.
On summing up his character, many years afterwards,
Gibbon writes of Fox as follows: “Perhaps no
human being was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint
of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood.”</p>

<p class='c021'>We know of no more fertile source of crime than Idleness.
It is the want of a due impression of the importance
and legitimate employment of time, which is one of the
main occasions of the luxury and profligacy of one order of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>society; and it is the same cause which vitiates and defiles
the manners of another, and a subordinate rank, in the
scale. It is inquired by an ancient poet, who was a keen
and accurate observer of human character, why Ægisthus
so grievously and wantonly deviated from the path of virtue?
and he immediately rejoins the reply, “The cause is
obvious,—he was idle!” And it is a circumstance worthy
of remark, that when Hogarth wished to give a portrait of
a veteran criminal, he made him commence his career as
a boy lolling on the tombstones of the churchyard on a
Sunday.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Ruskin has written these beautiful words of encouragement:
“God appoints to every one of His creatures a
separate mission; and if they discharge it honourably—if
they quit themselves like men, and faithfully follow that
light which is in them, withdrawing from it all cold and
quenching influence—there will assuredly come of it such
burning as, in its appointed mode and measure, shall shine
before men, and be of service, constant and holy. Degrees
infinite of lustre there must always be; but the weakest
among us has a gift, however seemingly trivial, which is
peculiar to him, and which, worthily used, will be a gift also
to his race for ever.”</p>

<p class='c021'>‘Know thyself’ is an old precept; yet it is surprising
how few are sufficiently acquainted with themselves to see
distinctly what their own motives actually are. It is a rare
thing, as well as a great advantage, for a man to know his
own mind.</p>

<p class='c021'>Were but a tithe of the time and the thought usually
spent in learning the commonest accomplishments bestowed
upon regulating our lives, how many evils would be
avoided or lessened; how many pleasures would be created
or increased!</p>

<p class='c021'>In one of Steele’s papers, No. 173 of the <i>Tatler</i>, are some
admirable remarks upon the time lost by boys in learning
that which, in after-life, is of little service to them. “The
truth of it is,” says Steele, “the first rudiments of education
are given very indiscreetly by most parents. Whatever children
are designed for, and whatever prospects the fortune
or interest of their parents may give them in their future
lives, they are all promiscuously instructed in the same way;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>and Horace and Virgil must be thumbed by a boy as well
before he goes to an apprenticeship as to the university....
This is the natural effect of a certain vanity in the
minds of parents, who are wonderfully delighted with the
thought of breeding their children to accomplishments,
which they believe nothing but the want of the same care in
their own fathers prevented them being masters of. Thus
it is that the part of life most fit for improvement is generally
employed against the bent of nature; and a lad of such
parts as are fit for an occupation where there can be no calls
out of the beaten path, is two or three years of his time
wholly taken up in knowing how well Ovid’s mistress became
such a dress, &amp;c.... However, still the humour
goes on from one generation to another; and the pastrycook
here in the lane, the other night, told me ‘he would not
take away his son from his learning; but has resolved, as
soon as he has had a little smattering in the Greek, to put
him apprentice to a soap-boiler.’ These wrong beginnings
determine our success in the world; and when our thoughts
are originally falsely biassed, their agility and force do but
carry us the farther out of our way, in proportion to our speed.
But we are half-way on our journey when we have got into
the right road. If all our ways were usefully employed, and
we did not set out impertinently, we should not have so
many grotesque professors in all the arts of life; but every
man would be in a proper and becoming method of distinguishing
or entertaining himself, suitably to what nature
designed him. As they go on now, our parents do not only
force upon us what is against our talents, but our teachers
are also as injudicious in what they put us to learn.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The practice of the irresolute in deliberating without
deciding is another parlous error. “What I cannot resolve
upon in half an hour,” said the Duc de Guise, “I cannot
resolve upon at all.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Bacon has well described this irresolution in his complaint,
“that some men object too much, consult too long,
adventure too little, repent too soon, and seldom drive business
home.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The strongest incentive to decision is self-dependence.
Mr. Sharp writes to a young friend at college:</p>

<p class='c028'>I have confidence in your capacity. However, my favourable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>anticipations arise chiefly from your being aware that your station in
society must depend entirely on your own exertions. Luckily, you
have not to overcome the disadvantage of expecting to inherit from
your father an income equal to your reasonable desires; for, though it
may have the air of a paradox, yet it is truly a serious disadvantage
when a young man going to the bar is sufficiently provided for.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c048'>says Martial, but not wisely; and no young man should believe him.</p>

<p class='c030'>The necessity for instant decision in life renders it often prudent to
take the chance of being right or wrong, without waiting to balance
reasons very nicely. In such cases, and sometimes even in speculation,
this kind of credulity is more philosophical than scepticism; though
authority in abstruse investigations should usually do little more than
excite attention, while in practice it must guide our conduct.</p>

<p class='c030'>It is unfortunate when a man’s intellectual and his moral character
are not suited to each other. The horses in a carriage should go the
same pace and draw in the same direction, or the motion will be neither
pleasant nor safe.</p>

<p class='c030'>Bonaparte has remarked of one of his marshals, that “he had a
military genius, but had not intrepidity enough in the field to execute
his own plans;” and of another he said, “he is as brave as his sword,
but he wants judgment and resources: neither,” he added, “is to be
trusted with a great command.”</p>

<p class='c030'>This want of harmony between the talents and the temperament is
often found in private life; and, wherever found, is the fruitful source
of faults and sufferings. Perhaps there are few less happy than those
who are ambitious without industry; who pant for the prize, but will
not run the race; who thirst for truth, but are too slothful to draw it
up from the well.</p>

<p class='c030'>Now this defect, whether arising from indolence or from timidity,
is far from being incurable. It may, at least in part, be remedied by
frequently reflecting on the endless encouragements to exertion held
out by our own experience and by example:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c029'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>C’est des difficultés que naissent les miracles.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c030'>It is not every calamity that is a curse, and <i>early</i> adversity especially
is often a blessing. Perhaps Madame de Maintenon would never
have mounted a throne had not her cradle been rocked in a prison.
Surmounted obstacles not only teach, but hearten us in our future
struggles; for virtue must be learnt, though unfortunately some of the
vices come, as it were, by inspiration. The austerities of our northern
climate are thought to be the cause of our abundant comforts; as our
wintry nights and our stormy seas have given us a race of seamen perhaps
unequalled, and certainly not surpassed, by any in the world.</p>

<p class='c030'>“Mother,” said a Spartan lad going to battle, “my sword is too
short.” “Add a step to it,” she replied; but it must be owned that
this advice was to be given only to a Spartan boy. They should not be
thrown into the water who cannot swim: I know your buoyancy, and
I have no fears of your being drowned.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>OFFICIAL LIFE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>The grand scramble for place was thus vividly painted
by Mr. Sharp some eighty years since: “The young people
of this country, in every rank, from a peer’s son to a street-sweeper’s,
are drawn aside from a praiseworthy exertion in
honest callings, by having their eyes directed towards the
public treasury. The rewards of persevering industry are
too slow for them, too small, and too insipid. They fondly
trust to the great lottery, although the wheel contains so
many blanks and so few prizes; hoping that their ticket
may be drawn a place, a pension, or a contract; a living, or
a stall; a ship, or a regiment; a seat on the bench, or the
great seal.</p>

<p class='c021'>“It is, indeed, most humiliating to witness the indecent
scramble that is always going on for these prizes, the highest
born and best educated rolling in the dirt to pick them
up, just as the lowest of the mob do for the shillings or the
pence thrown among them by a successful candidate at a
contested election.”</p>

<p class='c021'>In this rush there must always be a host of genius and
talent neglected or overlooked; and this from various causes,
some of which have been thus sketched by a living novelist,
accustomed to see far beyond most of his literary brethren:</p>

<p class='c028'>In all men who have devoted themselves to any study, or any art, with
sufficient pains to attain a certain degree of excellence, there must be a
fund of energy immeasurably above that of the ordinary herd. Usually,
this energy is concentred on the objects of their professional ambition,
and leaves them, therefore, apathetic to the other pursuits of men.
But where those objects are denied, where the stream has not its legitimate
vent, the energy, irritated and aroused, possesses the whole
being; and if not wasted on desultory schemes, or if not purified by
conscience and principle, becomes a dangerous and destructive element
in the social system, through which it wanders in riot and disorder.
Hence, in all wise monarchies—nay, in all well-constituted states—the
peculiar care with which channels are opened for every art and every
science; hence the honour paid to their cultivators by subtle and
thoughtful statesmen, who, perhaps, for themselves, see nothing in a
picture but coloured canvas—nothing in a problem but an ingenious
puzzle. No state is ever more in danger than when the talent which
should be consecrated to peace has no occupation but political intrigue
or personal advancement. Talent unhonoured is talent at war with
men.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c025'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c023'>Reliance upon family influence with persons in high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>stations is but a poor dependence.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c025'><sup>[94]</sup></a> We happen to know
a large family of sons unprovided for, who have been calculating
for years upon the influence of a maid-of-honour
with her relative, the Premier. But ministers who have the
good things to give away are often so pressed by their political
supporters, that their own connexions are made to
yield. The late Lord Melbourne was proverbially a good-natured
man; but in a case of the above kind he acted with
a sense of duty more stringent than might have been expected.
It appears that Lord John Russell had applied to
Lord Melbourne for some provision for one of the sons of
the poet Moore; and here is the Premier’s reply:</p>

<p class='c028'>“My dear John,—I return you Moore’s letter. I shall be ready to
do what you like about it when we have the means. I think whatever
is done should be done for Moore himself. This is more distinct, direct,
and intelligible. Making a small provision for young men is hardly
justifiable; and it is of all things the most prejudicial to themselves.
They think what they have much larger than it really is; and they
make no exertion. The young should never hear any language but
this: ‘You have your own way to make, and it depends upon your own
exertions whether you starve or not.’—Believe me, &amp;c.      <span class='sc'>Melbourne</span>.”<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c025'><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c023'>The foundation of the Sidmouth Peerage is traceable to
one of those fortunate turns which have much to do with
worldly success. It is related that while Lord Chatham was
residing at Hayes, in Kent, his first coachman being taken
ill, the postillion was sent for the family doctor; but not
finding him, the messenger returned, bringing with him
Mr. Addington, then a practitioner in the place, who, by
permission of Lord Chatham, saw the coachman, and reported
his ailment. His lordship was so pleased with Mr.
Addington, that he employed him as apothecary for the
servants, and then for himself; and, Lady Hester Stanhope
tells us, “finding he spoke good sense on medicine, and
then on politics, he at last made him his physician.” Dr.
Addington subsequently practised in the metropolis, then
retired to Reading, and there married; and in 1757 was
born his eldest son, Henry Addington, who was educated
at Winchester and Oxford, and called to the Bar in 1784.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Through his father’s connexion with the family of Lord Chatham,
an intimacy had grown up between young Addington
and William Pitt when they were boys. Pitt was now First
Minister of the Crown, and through his influence Addington
entered upon his long political career, and became in very
few years Prime Minister of England: his administration
was brief; but he was raised to the Peerage in 1805, and
held various offices until 1824, when he retired. Lord Sidmouth
was an unpopular minister, and not a man of striking
talent; but his aptitude for official business was great. He
survived until 1844, when he was succeeded by his eldest
son, the present Viscount, in holy orders.</p>

<p class='c021'>The origin of Lord Liverpool is scarcely less striking.
The father of this statesman was Mr. Robert Jenkinson, a
man of no patrimony, but who, by his application and aptitude
for State affairs, gave lustre to his name. In 1778 he
succeeded Lord Barrington as Secretary-at-War: he rose at
last to be Earl of Liverpool; and his son, the second Earl, to
be fifteen years First Lord of the Treasury.</p>

<p class='c021'>Another instance of successful integrity in Official Life is
presented by the Right Hon. George Rose, one of the most
valuable public servants which this country has known,—“an
able, clear-headed, straightforward man of business,
whose steady industry, devoted for years to the service of
the State, won for him, and most deservedly, not only political
importance, but the personal regard of his sovereign,
and indeed of all who knew him.”<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c025'><sup>[96]</sup></a> He was, in early life,
purser of a ship-of-war, where his abilities became known to
the Earl of Sandwich, by whom he was recommended to Lord
North, who gave him an appointment in the Treasury: he
was a man of frugal habits, and often ate his mutton-chop
at the Cat and Bagpipes tavern, at the corner of Downing-street;
<i>pari passu</i>, he was one of the early encouragers of
Savings-Banks. He was the sincere and devoted friend
of Pitt, whose personal character and administrative zeal
are nobly vindicated by the recent publication of Mr. Rose’s
Diaries and Correspondence. In 1777 he superintended the
publication of the Journals of the House of Lords, in thirty-one
folio volumes, from which time he rarely failed to be
employed in a public capacity by successive administrations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>In the intervals of his heavy official duties, he was enabled
to write several works upon political and administrative
questions of importance.</p>

<p class='c021'>John Barrow, born in a lowly cottage at Dragley Beck,
in Lancashire, rose, by his own earnest industry, to the
responsible post of a Secretary to the Admiralty, for forty
years, under thirteen administrations. When sixteen years
old, he made a voyage in a whaler to Greenland; he
next taught mathematics in a school at Greenwich. He
attended Lord Macartney in his celebrated embassy to
China, and took charge of the philosophical instruments
carried out as presents to the Emperor of China; of this
journey Barrow subsequently published an account in a
quarto volume. He was next appointed Secretary to Lord
Macartney, Governor of the Cape of Good Hope; and during
his leisure Mr. Barrow, in various journeys, collected
materials for a volume of <i>Travels in South Africa</i>, which he
published on his return to England. Throughout his Admiralty
secretaryship he was indefatigable in promoting the
progress of geographical or scientific knowledge, especially
in recommending to the governments under which he served
various voyages to the Arctic Regions. He was a man of
untiring industry, and devoted his leisure to literature and
scientific pursuits: he published various works; contributed
195 articles to the <i>Quarterly Review</i>; and at the age of eighty-three
(one year before his death) wrote his Autobiography.
His public services had been rewarded by a baronetcy in
1835; and shortly after his death, in 1848, upon the lofty
Hill of Hoad, near to the humble cottage in which Sir John
Barrow was born, there was erected, by public subscription,
to his memory, a sea-mark tower, as a record of what noble
distinction may be earned in this happy country by well-directed
energy and strictly moral worth.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>OFFICIAL QUALIFICATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Swift’s happy illustration of a frequent cause of failure,
drawn in the reign of Queen Anne,—whose administrators
were principally eminent scholars,—is scarcely so applicable
in our time. Men of great parts are often unfortunate
in the management of public business, because they are apt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>to go out of the common road by the quickness of their
imagination. This Swift once said to Lord Bolingbroke,
and desired he would observe that the clerk in his office
used a sort of ivory knife with a blunt edge to divide a
sheet of paper, which never failed to cut it even, only requiring
a steady hand; whereas, if they should make use of a
sharp penknife, the sharpness would make it go often out
of the crease, and disfigure the paper.</p>

<p class='c021'>A model Court-letter has been preserved by singular
accident. When Swift was looking out for the prebend and
sinecure of Dr. South, who was then very infirm, he received
the following letter from Lord Halifax, to whom Addison
had communicated Swift’s expectations:</p>

<div class='c050'>“<i>October 6, 1709.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<p class='c041'>“Sir,—Our friend Mr. Addison telling me that he was to write to
you to-night, I could not let his packet go away without letting you
know how much I am concerned to find them returned without you. I
am quite ashamed, for myself and my friends, to see you left in a place so
incapable of testing you; and to see so much merit, and so great qualities,
unrewarded by those who are sensible of them. Mr. Addison and I
are entered into a new confederacy, never to give over the pursuit, nor
to cease reminding those who can serve you, till your worth is placed in
that light it ought to shine in. Dr. South holds out still, but he cannot
be immortal. The situation of his prebend would make me doubly concerned
in serving you; and upon all occasions that shall offer, I will be
your constant solicitor, your sincere admirer, and your unalterable
friend.—I am your most humble and obedient servant,</p>
<div class='c051'><span class='sc'>Halifax</span>.”&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>

<p class='c023'>Sir W. Scott notes: “This letter from Lord Halifax, the
celebrated and almost professed patron of learning, is a
curiosity in its way, being a perfect model of a courtier’s
correspondence with a man of letters—condescending, obliging,
and probably utterly unmeaning. Dr. Swift wrote
thus on the back of the letter: ‘<i>I kept this letter as a true
original of courtiers and court promises;</i>’ and, on the first leaf
of a small printed book, entitled <i>Poésies Chrétiennes de Mons.
Jollivet</i>, he wrote these words: ‘Given me by my Lord Halifax,
May 3, 1709. I begged it of him, and desired him to
remember it was the only <i>favour</i> I ever received from him
or his party.’” Dr. South, it should be added, survived
until 1716, and then died, aged 83.</p>

<p class='c021'>Diplomatic Handwriting has been a point of some moment
with ministers, but has been tested in some strange
varieties. Lord Palmerston, who was so long Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs, was very particular as to hand-writing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>and the style in use in the Foreign-office is attributable
chiefly to him, but partly to Mr. Canning, who
laid down the rule that not more than ten lines should
be put into a page of foolscap. The handwriting of the
Foreign-office is peculiar: the letters are to be formed in
a particular way, the writing to be large and upright, and
the words well apart, so as to be easily legible; it is not
what a writing-master would teach as a good hand, and a
clerk has to acquire it in the Office. The Foreign-office has
been able to boast of the best handwriting in the public
service; but it is not so good as it was formerly, owing to
the great pressure for quick writing in order to prepare
papers that come down in the afternoon to go abroad the
same evening. A question put by Mr. Layard implied that
he had heard of despatches received from some of our ministers
abroad so ill-written that the originals could not be
sent to her Majesty, and copies had to be made for the purpose.
Mr. Hammond, of the Foreign office, states that this
could certainly not have occurred of late years; but he has
known two ambassadors of ours whose handwriting was the
most difficult to read that it is possible to conceive.</p>

<hr class='c027' />

<h3 class='c012'>PUBLIC SPEAKING.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The art of speaking well is unquestionably one of the
showiest qualifications for public life; although the drawback
of unsoundness may be as common now as when it
was classically expressed: <i>Satis eloquentiæ, sapientiæ parum</i>.
Little or no attention has been bestowed in modern times
on oratory as a separate branch of study; and eloquence has
come to be more admired as one of the rare gifts of nature,
than sought after as one of the fruits of art. The diffusion
of opinions and arguments by means of the press has perhaps
contributed in some degree to the present neglect of
oratory; for a speaker is mainly known to the public through
the press, and it is often more important to him to be <i>read</i>
than to be <i>heard:</i> the eloquence of the newspaper—that is,
the accomplishment of reporting—is the best oratory of our
times; but the following experiences may be useful.</p>

<p class='c021'>First, of one of the greatest orators of antiquity—Demosthenes.
Those who expect to find in his style of oratory
the fervid and impassioned language of a man carried away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>by his feelings to the prejudice of his judgment, will be disappointed.
He is said not to have been a ready speaker,
and to have required preparation. All his orations bear the
marks of an effort to convince the understanding rather than
to work on the passions of his hearers. And this is the
highest praise. Men may be <i>persuaded</i> by splendid imagery,
well-chosen words, and appeals to their passions; but to
convince by a calm and clear address, when the speaker has
no unfair advantage of person or of manner, and calls to
his aid none of the tricks of rhetoric,—this is what Cicero
calls the Oratory of Demosthenes, the ideal model of true
eloquence.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c025'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Demosthenes laboured under great physical disadvantages:
he was naturally of a weak constitution, had a feeble
voice, an indistinct articulation, and a shortness of breath.
To remedy these defects, he climbed up hills with pebbles
in his mouth, he declaimed on the sea-shore, or with a
sword hung so as to strike his shoulders when he made an
uncouth gesture. He is also said to have shut himself up
at times in a cave underground for study’s sake, and this
for months together.</p>

<p class='c021'>Next, of a great master of eloquence in our own times—Charles
James Fox, whom Lord Ossory describes as “one
of the most extraordinary men that ever existed.” He was
very young when his father, Henry, Lord Holland, finished
his political career; but hearing from his childhood a constant
conversation upon political subjects and the occurrences
in the House of Commons, he was, both by nature
and education, formed for a statesman. “His father delighted
to cultivate his talents by argumentation and reasoning with
him upon all subjects. He took his seat in the House of
Commons before he was twenty-one, and very shortly began
to show the dawn of those prodigious talents which he has
since displayed. He was much caressed by the then Ministry,
and appointed a Lord of the Admiralty, and soon promoted
to the Treasury. Lord North (which he must ever
since have repented) was inclined to turn him out upon
some trivial occasion or difference; and soon afterwards the
fatal quarrel with America commenced, Mr. Fox constantly
opposing the absurd measures of administration, and rising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>by degrees to be the first man the House of Commons ever
saw. His opposition continued from 1773 to 1782, when
the Administration was fairly overturned by his powers;
for even the great weight of ability, property, and influence
that composed the Opposition, could never have effected
that great work, if he had not acquired the absolute possession
and influence of the House of Commons. He certainly
deserved their confidence; for his political conduct had been
fair, open, honest, and decided, against the system so fatally
adopted by the Court. He resisted every temptation to be
brought over by that system, however flattering to his ambition;
for he must soon have been at the head of every
thing. But I do not know whether his abilities were not the
least extraordinary part about him. Perhaps that is saying
too much; but he was full of good nature, good temper, and
facility of disposition, disinterestedness with regard to himself,
at the same time that his mind was fraught with the most
noble sentiments and ideas upon all possible subjects. His
understanding had the greatest scope I can form an idea of,
his memory the most wonderful, his judgment the most
true, his reasoning the most profound and acute, his eloquence
the most rapid and persuasive.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Scarcely any person has ever become a great debater
without long practice and many failures. It was by slow
degrees, as Burke said, that Fox became the most brilliant
and powerful debater that ever lived. Fox himself attributed
his own success to the resolution which he formed
when very young, of speaking, well or ill, at least once every
night. “During five whole sessions,” he used to say, “I
spoke every night but one; and I regret only that I did not
speak that night too.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The model of a debate is that given by Milton in the
opening of the second book of <i>Paradise Lost</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Sharp tells of the first meetings of a society at a
public school, in which two or three evenings were consumed
in debating whether the floor should be covered with
a sail-cloth or a carpet; and better practice was gained in
these unimportant discussions than in those that soon followed,—on
liberty, slavery, passive obedience, and tyrannicide.
It has been truly said, that nothing is so unlike a
battle as a review.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Sir E. Bulwer Lytton has well illustrated a defect even
in great orators, namely, nervousness; he says: “I doubt
whether there has been any public speaker of the highest
order of eloquence who has not felt an anxiety or apprehension,
more or less actually painful, before rising to address
an audience upon any very important subject on which he
has meditated beforehand. This nervousness will, indeed,
probably be proportioned to the amount of previous preparation,
even though the necessities of reply, or the changeful
temperament which characterises public assemblies, may
compel the orator to modify, alter, perhaps wholly reject,
what, in previous preparation, he had designed to say. The
fact of preparation itself had impressed him with the dignity
of the subject—with the responsibilities that devolve
on an advocate from whom much is expected, on whose
individual utterance results affecting the interests of many
may depend. His imagination had been roused and warmed,
and there is no imagination where there is no sensibility.
Thus the orator had mentally surveyed, as it were, at a distance,
the loftiest height of his argument; and now, when
he is about to ascend to it, the awe of the altitude is felt.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The late Marquis of Lansdowne one day remarked to Thomas
Moore, that he hardly ever spoke in the House of Lords
without feeling the approaches of some loss of self-possession,
and found that the only way to surmount it was to
talk on at all hazards. He added, what appears highly probable,
that those <i>commonplaces</i> which most men accustomed
to public speaking have ready cut and dry, to bring in on
all occasions, were, he thought, in general used by them as
a mode of getting out of those blank intervals, when they
do not know <i>what</i> to say next, but, in the mean time, must
say <i>something</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. John Scott Russell, the eminent engineer, gives the
following practical hints: “In a large room, nearly square,
the best place to speak from is near one corner, with the
voice directed diagonally to the opposite corner. In all
rooms of common forms, the lowest pitch of voice that will
reach across the room will be most audible. In all such
rooms, it is better to speak along the length of the room
than across it; and a low ceiling will, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, convey
the sound better than a high one. It is better, generally,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>to speak from pretty near a wall or pillar, than far
away from it. It is desirable that the speaker should speak
in the key-note of the room, and evenly, but not loud.”</p>

<p class='c021'>To be well acquainted with the subject is of prime importance.
Malone relates an amusing instance of failure in
this respect in one of our greatest orators. Lord Chatham,
when Mr. Pitt, on some occasion made a very long and able
speech in the Privy Council relative to some naval matter.
Every one present was struck by the force of his eloquence.
Lord Anson, who was by no means eloquent, being then at
the head of the Admiralty, and differing entirely in opinion
from Mr. Pitt, got up, and only said these words: “My
Lords, Mr. Secretary is very eloquent, and has stated his
own opinion very plausibly. I am no orator; and all I
shall say is, that he knows nothing at all of what he has
been talking about.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Flood, the Irish orator, being told that he seemed
to argue with somewhat less of his usual vigour when engaged
on the wrong side of the question, happily replied
that he “could not escape from the force of his own understanding.”
This must be the origin of the shrewd observation,
that some clever persons are “educated beyond their
own understanding.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Brougham, writing to the father of Thomas Babington
Macaulay when the latter was at Cambridge University,
urged the following, with a view to the great promise for
public speaking which Macaulay then possessed, and of
which Lord Grey had spoken in terms of the highest
praise. “He takes his accounts from his son,” says Mr.
Brougham; “but from all I know, and have learnt in other
quarters, I doubt not that his judgment is well formed.
Now, of course, you destine him for the Bar; and, assuming
that this, and the public objects incidental to it, are in his
views, I would fain impress upon you (and through you,
upon him) a truth or two which experience has made me
aware of, and which I would have given a great deal to have
been acquainted with earlier in life from the experience of
others.</p>

<p class='c021'>“1. The beginning of the art is to acquire a habit of <i>easy
speaking</i>; and in whatever way this can be had (which individual
inclination or accident will generally direct, and may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>safely be allowed to do so), it must be had. Now, I differ
from all other doctors of rhetoric in this: I say, let him first
of all learn to speak safely and fluently; as well and as
sensibly as he can, no doubt, but at any rate let him learn
to speak. This is to eloquence or good speaking what the
being able to talk in a child is to correct grammatical speech.
It is the requisite foundation, and on it you must build.
Moreover, it can only be acquired young: therefore, let it
by all means, and at any sacrifice, be gotten hold of forthwith.
But in acquiring it, every sort of slovenly error will
also be acquired. It must be got by a habit of easy writing—which,
as Wyndham said, proved hard reading; by a custom
of talking much in company; by debating in speaking societies,
with little attention to rule, and more love of saying
something at any rate, than of saying any thing well. I can
even suppose that more attention is paid to the matter in
such discussions than to the manner of saying it; yet still
to say it easily, <i>ad libitum</i>, to say what you choose, and what
you have to say, this is the first requisite; to acquire which
every thing else must for the present be sacrificed.</p>

<p class='c021'>“2. The next step is the grand one: to convert this
style of easy speaking into chaste eloquence. And here there
is but one rule. I do earnestly entreat your son to set
daily and nightly before him the Greek models. First of
all, he may look to the best modern speeches (as probably
he has already); but he must by no means stop
here; if he would be a great orator, he must go at once
to the fountain-head, and be familiar with every one of the
great orations of Demosthenes. I take for granted that
he knows those of Cicero by heart; they are very beautiful,
but not very useful, except, perhaps, the <i>Milo, pro
Ligario</i>, and one or two more: but the Greek must positively
be the model; and merely reading it, as boys do,
won’t do at all; he must enter into the spirit of each speech,
thoroughly know the positions of the parties, follow each
turn of the argument, and make the absolutely perfect and
most chaste and severe composition familiar in his mind.
His taste will improve every time he reads and repeats to
himself (for he should have the fine passages by heart); and
he will learn how much may be done by the skilful use of
a few words, and a vigorous rejection of all superfluities.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>In this view I hold a familiar knowledge of Dante as being
next to Demosthenes. It is in vain to say that imitation
of these models won’t do for our times. First, I do not
counsel any imitation, but only an imbibing of the same
spirit. Secondly, I know from experience that nothing is
half so successful in these times (bad though they be) as
what had been formed on the Greek models. I use a very
poor instance in giving my own experience; but I do assure
you, that both in courts of law and Parliament, and even
in mobs, I have never made so much play (to use a very
modern phrase) as when I was almost translating from the
Greek. I composed the peroration of my speech for the
Queen in the Lords, after reading and repeating Demosthenes
for three or four weeks, and I composed it over twenty
times at least; and it certainly succeeded in a very extraordinary
degree, and far above any merits of its own. This
leads me to remark, that though speaking with writing beforehand
is very well until the habit of any speech is
acquired, yet, after that, he can never write too much: this
is quite clear. It is laborious, no doubt, and it is more
difficult beyond comparison than speaking offhand; but it
is necessary to perfect oratory, and at any rate it is necessary
to acquire the habit of correct diction. But I go further,
and say, even to the end of a man’s life, he must prepare
word for word most of his fine passages. Now, would he be
a great orator or no? In other words, would he have almost
absolute power of doing good to mankind in a free country
or no? So he wills this, he must follow these rules.—Believe
me truly yours,</p>
<div class='c022'><span class='sc'>H. Brougham</span>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<p class='c021'>A contemporary journalist<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c025'><sup>[98]</sup></a> has well observed of the oratory
of the present day: “With all its great defects, which
are perceptible enough to any cultivated hearer, Public
Speaking is one of the greatest treats you can provide for
the middle and higher population of one of our towns. The
extempore oration is of course often a rough production;
it does not at all come up to our ideas of the perfection of
language, but it fascinates and fetters attention as being
extempore,—as displaying the energy of an actual creation
on the spot. Lord Derby’s is perhaps the best oratorical
language we have,—we mean when he speaks his best; it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>is properly different from book-language, and yet does not
run into the technical inflation, and conventional bombast,
and professional phraseology, which are the dangers of
oratory. Mr. Gladstone’s is Parliamentary English—a very
surprising and brilliant creation, but one that has gone
through a medium of technicality or conventionalism, and
does not come straight from the fount of language. The
Bishop of Oxford’s oratory is open to the criticism that it
is overstrained, and produces vivid pictorial effects at the
cost of simplicity. This is no very severe or invidious criticism,
because in nine cases out of ten an orator who selects
an exaggerated phrase selects it because a simpler one does
not come to hand. A ready and inexhaustible command of
the simplest and truest words is, of course, the very triumph
of oratory, and a most rare triumph. Still, with all
its defects, oratory is oratory: it is an uncommon exhibition
of power; it creates interest, and sustains attention as
such; and we are not sorry that our provincial towns have
now the opportunity of hearing most of our leading public
speakers.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Akin to the present subject is the art of presiding over a
festive company, for which Sir Walter Scott has left these
few simple practical rules:</p>

<p class='c028'>1st. Always hurry the bottle round for five or six rounds, without
prosing yourself, or permitting others to prose. A slight fillip of wine
inclines people to be pleased, and removes the nervousness which prevents
men from speaking—disposes them, in short, to be amusing, and
to be amused.</p>

<p class='c041'>2d. Push on, keep moving! as young Rapid says. Do not think of
saying fine things—nobody cares for them any more than for fine music,
which is often too liberally bestowed on such occasions. Speak at all
ventures, and attempt the <i>mot pour rire</i>. You will find people satisfied
with wonderfully indifferent jokes, if you can but hit the taste of
the company, which depends much on its character. Even a very high
party, primed with all the cold irony and <i>non est tanti</i> feelings, or no
feelings of fashionable folks, may be stormed by a jovial, rough, round,
and ready præses. Choose your text with discretion—the sermon may
be as you like. Should a drunkard or an ass break in with any thing
out of joint, if you can parry it with a jest, good and well; if not, do
not exert your serious authority, unless it is something very bad. The
authority even of a chairman ought to be very cautiously exercised.
With patience, you will have the support of every one.</p>

<p class='c041'>3d. When you have drunk a few glasses to play the good fellow and
banish modesty (if you are unlucky enough to have such a troublesome
companion), then beware of the cup too much. Nothing is so ridiculous
as a drunken preses.</p>

<p class='c041'>Lastly, always speak short, and <i>Skeoch doch na skiel</i>—cut a tale
with a drink.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>OPPORTUNITY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>To <i>bide the time</i> is often the means, though slow, of reaping
success. Late in the last century, a printseller settled
in a leading street of the artistic locality of Soho: during the
first six weeks he kept shop, his receipts were not as many
pence; nevertheless he was civil and obliging to all callers
and inquirers, to whom, in the printselling business, customers
are a very small proportion. This obliging disposition
was his main investment, and his shop grew to be
the resort of print-collectors of all grades—from the rich
duke to the hard-working engraver; he became wealthy,
and died bequeathing to his family a considerable fortune,
and the finest stock of prints in the metropolis.</p>

<p class='c021'>Extraordinary instances have occurred of latent genius
having been discovered by some lucky accident, and fostered
to high position. Isaac Ware, the architect and editor
of <i>Palladio</i>, was originally a chimney-sweeper, and, when a
boy, was seated one day in front of Whitehall-palace, upon
the pavement, whereon he had drawn in chalk the elevation
of a building. This attracted the notice of a gentleman in
passing, and led him to inquire who had chalked out the
building. The boy replied, it was his own work; the unknown
patron then took the lad to the master-sweeper to
whom he was apprenticed, purchased his indenture, and
forthwith had little Ware educated: he rose to be one of
the leading architects of his day, and among other edifices
he built Chesterfield-house, in South Audley-street, one of
the handsomest mansions in the metropolis. Ware died in
1766; and, it is said, retained the stain of <i>soot</i> in his face to
the day of his death.</p>

<hr class='c027' />

<h3 class='c012'>MEN OF BUSINESS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Our forefathers appear to have conveyed much of their
instructions in Business Life by way of apophthegm. In
the <i>Spectator</i>, No. 109, it is observed that “the man proper
for the business of money and the advancement of gain,
speaking in the general, is of a sedate, plain, good understanding,
not apt to go out of his way, but so behaving himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>at home that business may come to him. Sir William
Turner, that valuable citizen, has left behind him a most
excellent rule, and couched it in a very few words, suited
to the meanest capacity. He would say, ‘Keep your shop,
and your shop will keep you.’” [Alderman Thomas, the
mercer in Paternoster-row, made this one of the mottoes of
his shop.] “It must be confessed, that if a man of a great
genius could add steadiness to his vivacities, or substitute
slower men of fidelity to transact the methodical part of his
affairs, such an one would outstrip the rest of the world:
but business and trade are not to be managed by the same
heads which write poetry and make plans for the conduct
of life in general.”</p>

<p class='c021'>However, Bacon thought otherwise. “Let no man,” he
says, “fear lest learning should expulse business; nay,
rather, it will keep and defend the possessions of the mind
against idleness and pleasure, which otherwise, at unawares,
may enter to the prejudice both of business and pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The proper time—“<i>rerum est omnium primum</i>.” “To
choose time,” says Bacon, “is to save time; and an unseasonable
motion is but beating the air. There be three parts
of business: the preparation; the debate, or examination;
and the perfection; whereof, if you look for despatch, let
the middle only be the work of many, and the first and last
the work of few.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Sir Robert Walpole had in his mind a man not apt to go
out of his way, when he described Henry Legge, his Chancellor
of the Exchequer, as having “very little rubbish in
his head;” meaning that he was a practical, useful man of
business.</p>

<p class='c021'>There are few persons who have not met with cases of
hypochondriacs who have been relieved and made more
happy by useful and disinterested occupation in promoting
the welfare of others. Dr. Heberden used to relate a striking
case of this kind. Captain Blake was a hypochondriac
for several years, and during that time every week or two
he consulted the Doctor, who had not only prescribed all
the medicines likely to correct disease arising from bodily
infirmity, but every argument which humanity and good
sense could suggest for the comfort of his mind; but in
vain. At length Dr. Heberden heard no more of his patient,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>till after a considerable interval he found that Captain Blake
had formed a project for conveying fish to London, from
some of the seaports in the west, by means of light carts
adapted for expeditious land-carriage. The arrangement
and various occupations of the mind in carrying out this object
entirely superseded all sense of his former malady, which
from that time never returned.</p>

<p class='c021'>Innumerable are the instances of men retiring from
business in middle life, yet yearning to return to it,—so
strong is the habit of occupation. We all remember the
story of the city tallow-chandler, who retired into the suburbs,
having sold his business, with the proviso that he
should come to town on a melting-day. One of the partners
of a large publishing house, some years since, retired
into Wales; but did not long survive the change, to enjoy
his well-earned fortune. Another instance occurs: a tradesman
retired from business with a fortune, and travelled for
some time to divert <i>ennui</i>; but this not succeeding, he returned
to active life in manufacturing and patenting lamps
and kettles, night-lights and potato-saucepans, and, in such
small ingenuities, finds himself happy again.</p>

<p class='c021'>The late Mr. Charles Tilt, the well-known publisher in
Fleet-street, retired from business in middle life; travelled
many years in each quarter of the world; and wrote a pleasant
little book, entitled <i>The Boat and the Caravan</i>. He had
been articled to Longman and Co.; then lived with Mr.
Hatchard, in Piccadilly; and next established himself with
great success. Notwithstanding his long retirement, his
business habits never forsook him: he generously acted as
trustee in the settlement of the affairs of his late partner,
Mr. David Bogue, who had succeeded to the entire concern
in Fleet-street; and he next officiated as executor to the
estate of the late Mr. Hatchard, with whom he had formerly
lived. Mr. Tilt died in 1862, leaving the large property of
180,000<i>l.</i></p>

<hr class='c027' />

<h3 class='c012'></h3>
<p class='c023'>CHARACTER THE BEST SECURITY.</p>

<p class='c021'>“I owe my success in business chiefly to you,” said a
stationer to a paper-maker, as they were settling a large
account; “but let me ask how a man of your caution came to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>give credit so freely to a beginner with my slender means?”
“Because,” replied the paper-maker, “at whatever hour in
the morning I passed to my business, I always observed you
without your coat at yours.” Upon this Mr. Walker, the
police-magistrate, observes: “I knew both parties. Different
men will have different degrees of success, and every
man must expect to experience ebbs and flows; but I fully
believe that no one in this country, of whatever condition,
who is really attentive, and, what is of great importance,
who lets it appear that he is so, can fail in the long-run.
Pretence is ever bad; but there are many who obscure their
good qualities by a certain carelessness, or even an affected
indifference, which deprives them of the advantages they
would otherwise infallibly reap, and then they complain of
the injustice of the world. The man who conceals or disguises
his merit might as well expect to be thought clean
in his person if he chose to go covered with filthy rags.
The world will not, and cannot in great measure, judge but
by appearances; and worth must stamp itself, if it hopes to
pass current, even against baser metal:</p>

<h3 class='c012'>ENGINEERS AND MECHANICIANS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>“No man can look back on the last twenty or thirty
years without feeling that it has been <i>the age of Engineers
and Mechanicians</i>. The profession has, in that period of
time, done much to change the aspect of human affairs;
for what agency during that period, single or combined, can
be compared in its effects, or in its tendency towards the
amelioration of the condition of mankind, with the establishment
of railroads, of the electric telegraph, and to the
improvement in steam navigation?”</p>

<p class='c028'>“The wide range of the profession of an Engineer requires the assistance
of many departments of science and art, and must call into employment
important branches of manufacture. He can perform no great
work without the aid of a great variety of workmen; and it is on their
strength and skill, as well as on their scientific direction, that the perfection
of his work will depend. The personal experience of one individual
cannot fit him for the exigencies of a profession which is ever
extending its range of subjects, and is constantly dealing with new and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>complex phenomena,—phenomena which are all the more difficult
to deal with from the fact, that they are generally surrounded by such
variable circumstances as render them incapable of being submitted to
precise measurement and calculation, or of being made amenable to
the deductions of exact science. Consequently, nothing is more certain
than that he who wishes to reach the perfection of his art must
avail himself of the experience of others as well as his own, and that he
will not unfrequently find the sum of the whole little enough to guide
him. And let no inventive genius suppose that his own tendencies or
capabilities relieve him from this necessity.</p>

<p class='c041'>“There is no such thing as discovery and invention, in the sense
which is sometimes attached to the words. Men do not suddenly discover
new worlds, or invent new machines, or find new metals. Some
indeed may be, and are, better fitted than others for such purposes;
but the progress of discovery is, and always has been, much the same.
<i>There is nothing really worth having that man has obtained that has not
been the result of a combined and gradual progress of investigation.</i> A
gifted individual comes across some old footmark, and stumbles on a
chain of previous research and inquiry. He meets, for instance, with
a machine, the result of much previous labour; he modifies it, pulls it
to pieces, constructs and reconstructs it, and, by further trial and experiment,
he arrives at the long-sought-for result.”</p>

<p class='c023'>Such were the emphatic words of Mr. Hawkshaw, F.R.S.,
in opening his Address on his election as President of the
Institution of Civil Engineers, session 1861-62. It would
not be difficult to illustrate the President’s data by many
bright instances of their truth. But we remember too well
the sad story of Myddleton bringing the New River to our
metropolis, a very early engineering labour, who, although
he died not so poor as is usually represented, yet his family
fell into decay. Almost equally familiar is the story of the
life of George Stephenson, the maturer of the locomotive
engine; and the career of his son, Robert Stephenson, the
constructor of the London and Birmingham Railway, and
second only to his father as a railway engineer. George
learned to read and write at night-schools, and “figuring”
by the engine-fires. As Robert grew up, his father was
enabled to send him to Edinburgh University, where he
acquired some knowledge in mathematics and geology:
these acquisitions afforded subjects for comment and discussion
between him and his father, and were of valuable
use to both in their future joint avocations; and when the
father had retired, in the sphere of railways Robert was
recognised as the foremost man, the safest guide, and the
most active worker. In the great railway mania of 1844, he
was engineer for thirty-three new schemes; and his income
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>was large, beyond any previous instance of engineering
gain. His other great railway achievements were, the High-level
Bridge at Newcastle; the Chester and Holyhead line;
he constructed the Britannia and Conway tubular bridges,
and designed the tubular bridges for Canada and Egypt.
These intense labours brought him to his grave in his fifty-sixth
year. It has been truly said of Robert Stephenson:</p>

<p class='c028'>“He almost worshiped his father’s memory, and said he owed all to
his father’s training, his example, and his character; and he declared
in public: ‘It is my great pride to remember that, whatever may have
been done, and however extensive may have been my own connexion in
the railway development, all I owe, and all I have done is primarily
due, to the parent whose memory I cherish and revere.’ Like his
father, he was eminently practical, and yet always open to the influence
and guidance of correct theory.</p>

<p class='c041'>“In society Robert Stephenson was simple, unobtrusive, and modest;
but charming, and even fascinating, in an eminent degree. Sir John
Lawrence has said of him, that he was, of all others, the man he most
delighted to meet in England, he was so manly, yet gentle, and withal
so great.</p>

<p class='c041'>“His great wealth enabled him to perform many generous acts in a
right noble and yet modest manner, not letting his right hand know
what his left hand did.”<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c025'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c023'>In the life of Thomas Telford, we have another striking
instance of a man who, by the force of natural talent, unaided
save by uprightness and persevering industry, raised
himself from low estate to take his stand among the master-spirits
of the age. He was born in 1757, in Dumfriesshire,
sent to the parish-school, and employed as a shepherd-boy;
in his leisure, delighted to read the books lent him by his
village friends. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed
to a stone-mason, and for several years worked on bridges
and stone-buildings, village-churches, and manses, in his
native district. In 1780 he went to Edinburgh, and for two
years closely attended to architecture and drawing. He
then removed to London, and worked upon the quadrangle
of Somerset House, under Sir William Chambers, as architect.
His next practice was in the construction of graving-docks,
wharf-walls, and similar engineering works; and he
built above forty bridges in Shropshire. His greatest works
are, the Ellesmere Canal, 103 miles in length, with its
wonderful aqueduct-bridges; the Caledonian Canal, which
cost a million of money; the Bedford Level, and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>important drainage works; 1000 miles of Highland roads
and 1200 bridges; St. Katherine’s Docks, London, constructed
with unexampled rapidity; and the great road
from London to Holyhead, and the works connected with
it. The Menai Suspension Bridge is a noble example of
his boldness in designing, and practical skill in executing
a novel and difficult work; and it is related of him
that, just previous to the fixing of the last bar, he knelt in
private prayer to the Giver of all good for the successful
completion of the great work. Telford left an account of
his labours of more than half a century; yet he found time
to teach himself Latin, French, Italian, and German. He
was the first president of the Institution of Civil Engineers,
in whose theatre is a noble portrait of him; and in Westminster
Abbey, where he is interred, is a marble statue of
the Eskdale shepherd-boy, whose works, in number, magnitude,
and usefulness, are unrivalled.</p>

<p class='c021'>John Rennie, who designed three of the noblest bridges
in the world, in addition to other great engineering works,
was born in 1761, in the county of East Lothian. He learned
his first lessons in mechanics in the workshop of a millwright;
before he was eleven years old he had constructed
a windmill, a pile-engine, and a steam-engine; he next
learned elementary mathematics and mechanics, and drawing
machinery and architecture, and attended lectures on
mechanical philosophy and chemistry. His greatest works
are the Plymouth Breakwater; Waterloo, Southwark, and
London bridges; the London, East and West India Docks;
and great steam-engines; his principal undertakings having
cost forty millions sterling. He was rarely occupied in business
less than twelve hours a day; he seldom illustrated
his information with any other instrument than a two-foot
rule, which he always carried in his pocket. He owed his
good fortune to talent, industry, prudence, perseverance,
boldness of conception, soundness of judgment, and habits
of untiring application: his works were indeed executed for
posterity.</p>

<p class='c021'>Sir Edward Banks, who built Rennie’s three stupendous
bridges, was a labourer at Chipstead on the Merstham railway,
some sixty years since: by his own natural abilities,
which had not been cultivated to any extent, and by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>integrity and perseverance, he became contractor for public
works, and acquired great wealth: and it shows the simplicity
of his nature, that, struck with the retired picturesqueness
of Chipstead churchyard, he chose it for the depository
of his remains, where the tablet to his memory bears his
bust, and an arch and the three great bridges,—the goal
of his remarkable career.</p>

<p class='c021'>The history of the life of the elder Brunel is strangely
tinged with romance. He was born in Normandy in 1769,
was early intended for the priesthood; but when at the college
of Gisors, he would steal away to the village carpenter’s
shop, and draw faces and plans, and learn to handle tools;
and one day, seeing a new tool in a cutler’s window, he
pawned his hat to purchase it. He was next sent to the ecclesiastical
seminary of St. Nicaise at Rouen; there, in his play-hours,
he loved to watch the ships along the quay; and seeing
some large iron castings landed from an English ship, he
inquired, Where had they come from? and on being told from
England, the boy exclaimed, “Ah, when I am a man, I will
go and see the country where such grand machines are
made.” On his return home, he continued his mechanical
recreations; made musical instruments; and invented a
nightcap-making machine, which is still used by the peasantry
in that part of Normandy. His father now gave up
all hope of his son for the priesthood, and had him qualified
to enter the navy, and at seventeen he was nominated to
a royal corvette; but while serving there he continued his
mechanical pursuits, and made for himself a quadrant in
ebony. His ship having been paid off in 1792, Brunel went
to Paris, where he nearly fell a victim to the fury of the
Revolution; but he escaped to Rouen, and thence fled to
the United States, where he landed in 1793. While at
New York, the idea of his block-machinery occurred to
him. He now executed canal surveys, and designed the
Park Theatre, and superintended its erection; he was next
appointed chief engineer for New York, and there erected
a cannon-foundry, with novel contrivances for casting and
boring guns. He left New York in January 1799, and landed
at Falmouth in the following March: there he met his early
love, Sophia Kingdom, and the pair were shortly after united
for life.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Brunel brought with him to England a duplicate writing
and drawing machine; a machine for twisting cotton-thread
and forming it into balls; a machine for trimmings
and borders for muslins, lawns, and cambrics. The famous
block-machinery was Brunel’s next invention; then various
wood-working machinery, and machines for manufacturing
shoes; and next the Battersea saw-mills; but the
failure of the two latter speculations brought Brunel into
difficulties, from which he was extricated by a government
grant of 5000<i>l.</i>, in consideration of the savings by the use of
his block-machinery. He then improved the stocking-knitting
machine and steam-engine; metallic paper and crystallised
tinfoil; improvements in stereotyping and the treadmill.
In engineering, he designed suspension, swing, and
other bridges, and machines for boring cannon. He next experimented
with a boat on the Thames, fitted with a double-action
engine, and made his first voyage in it to Margate
in 1814, when he narrowly escaped personal violence from
the proprietors of the sailing-boats. Marine engines and
paddle-wheels were next improved by Brunel; and these
were followed by his carbonic-acid gas engine, which proved
too costly a machine. Then came the crowning event of his
life, the construction of the Thames Tunnel, taking the idea
of his excavating-machine from the boring operations of the
<i>Teredo navalis</i>. In this formidable work he was assisted
by his son, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, then only nineteen
years of age; and after most perilous operations, the tunnel
was completed, and opened March 25th, 1843. This was the
engineer’s last work: as a commercial adventure it proved
disastrous, which preyed on the mind of Brunel; though he
lived six years longer, until he had attained his 81st year.</p>

<p class='c021'>The younger Brunel’s first great work was the Clifton
Suspension Bridge, followed by docks at Bristol and Sunderland,
and several colliery tramways. In 1835, he was
appointed engineer of the Great Western Railway, being
then only about twenty-eight years of age, but skilful and
ingenious, and anxious to strike out an entirely new course
in railway engineering. He adopted the broad-gauge, then
a great and novel enterprise, but now ascertained to be unnecessary:
the works were unusually costly, and so novel
that the line was called the Grand Experimental Railway;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>while it rendered Brunel famous as a railway engineer. He
next attempted the atmospheric principle; but this proved
unsuccessful, and the loss exceeded half a million of money.
His last and greatest railway engineering achievements were
his “bowstring-girder” bridges at Chepstow and Saltash:
the latter has two wrought-iron tubes, each weighing upwards
of 1000 tons, and the viaduct and bridge are nearly
half a mile, or 300 feet longer than the Britannia bridge.
The central Saltash pier foundations, upon solid rock, 90
feet below the surface of the river, were laid within a
wrought-iron cylinder 37 feet in diameter and 100 feet
high, and the whole work involved six years’ toil, anxiety,
and peril.</p>

<p class='c021'>Next, Brunel devised an iron-plated armed ship capable
of withstanding the fire of the Sebastopol forts; but his
grand triumphs as a naval engineer were, the <i>Great Western</i>,
steam-ship, propelled by paddle-wheels; and the <i>Great Britain</i>,
propelled by a screw; but these were thrown into the
shade by his <i>Great Eastern</i>, combining the powers of the
paddle-wheel and the screw; and which, with the aid of Mr.
Scott Russell, its builder, was completed and launched,—the
largest ship that has ever floated. But this stupendous
labour had undermined Mr. Brunel’s health; he was seized
with paralysis, and died at the comparatively early age of
fifty-three.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c025'><sup>[100]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Of Brunel’s great engineering skill there can be no
question; he loved difficulties and engineering perils: he
has been styled “the Michael Angelo of Railways;” and his
victory in “the Battle of the Gauges” gained him extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>prominence in the railway world. His ruling passion
was magnitude, without regard to cost: “he was the very
Napoleon of engineers, thinking more of glory than of profit,
and of victory than of dividends.” Capitalists subscribed
to his projects freely, and he put his own savings into the
same risks; if shareholders suffered, he suffered with them;
and it must be conceded that both railway travelling and
steam navigation have been greatly advanced by the speculative
ability of Mr. Brunel’s Titanic labours.</p>

<p class='c021'>The career of Joseph Locke, civil engineer, though less
brilliant than that of Brunel, was one of more sterling
worth. He was born in Yorkshire, in 1805, the son of a
fellow-workman with George Stephenson at the pit. Locke
had little schooling, and failing in two or three humble
services, at the age of nineteen he became George Stephenson’s
pupil, and then his assistant, taking charge of
the survey of railway lines; he was appointed engineer-in-chief
of the Grand Junction and South-Western lines; and
next initiated the Continental Railway system, promoting
the rapid communication between London and Paris. He
was made a chevalier and officer of the Legion of Honour,
and sat in the British Parliament for Honiton. He died at
the early age of fifty-five, leaving great wealth to his widow
(a daughter of Mr. M‘Creery, the literary printer), to form
in the North a public park, and found a scholarship.</p>

<p class='c028'>The high celebrity of Mr. Locke was not due to the fact of his making
railways. It was, that he made them within the estimated cost,—an
achievement which would sooner or later have been attained by
the ordinary operations of capital. The Grand Junction Railway was
eventually constructed for a sum within the estimate, and at an average
cost of less than 15,000<i>l.</i> a mile. The heavy works on the Caledonian
line were completed at less than 16,000<i>l.</i> a mile. This economical
success was in a great measure owing to the adoption of a bold system
of steep gradients—an expedient which Stephenson, it appears, disliked
to the last, and which was a prevailing feature in his active rival’s
designs. Locke hated a tunnel, and with embankments and inclines
would encounter any difficulty.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c025'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c023'>Thomas Cubitt, the great metropolitan builder and contractor,
was another remarkable man of this class. He was
born at Buxton, near Norwich, in 1788. At the time of his
father’s death he was nineteen years old, and working as
a journeyman carpenter. He next took a voyage to India
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>and back, as captain’s joiner; and, on his return to the
metropolis, with his savings began business as a master-carpenter.
Within six years he erected large workshops in
Gray’s-inn-road. One of his earliest works was building the
London Institution in Moorfields. About 1824, he began
to build Tavistock-square, Gordon-square, Woburn-place,
and the adjoining streets; and next engaged to cover with
houses large portions of the Five Fields, Chelsea, of which
engagement Belgrave-square, Lowndes-square, and Chesham-place
are the results.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c025'><sup>[102]</sup></a> He subsequently contracted to
build over the large open district between Eaton-square and
the Thames, now known as South Belgravia. He had completed
most of his large engagements, and had just built
for himself a mansion at Denbies, where he died in his
sixty-seventh year, possessed of great wealth. Through life
he constantly promoted the intellectual and moral improvement
of his work-people. One of his brothers, and partner in
business, is Mr. William Cubitt, M.P., who has twice served
the office of Lord Mayor, and was, like his relative, originally
a ship’s carpenter.</p>

<p class='c021'>Thomas Brassey, the railway contractor, is another remarkable
instance of colossal labour. Born at Buerton in
1805, and educated at Chester, he commenced life as a surveyor
at Birkenhead; and his first railway work was a contract
to supply the stone for a viaduct of the Liverpool and
Manchester line. From this period to the present hour, he
has constructed, upon his own responsibility and credit, many
hundred miles of railway in England, Scotland, France,
Spain, and Canada, at the cost of millions of money. A
striking instance of his energy and enterprise occurred in
one of his French contracts. When the Barentine viaduct,
of twenty arches, on the Rouen and Havre Railway, was
nearly completed, the work gave way, and the casualty involved
a loss of 30,000<i>l.</i> Mr. Brassey was neither morally
nor legally responsible—he had repeatedly protested against
the material used in the structure; but the viaduct was rebuilt
entirely at Mr. Brassey’s cost.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Mr. George Bidder, the engineer, presents one of the
few examples of early habits of calculation being matured
to advantage. When about six years of age, he was first
introduced to the science of figures. His father was a working
man; his elder brother commenced instructing him to
count up to 10, then to 100, and there he stopped. He
repeated the process, and found that by stopping at 10, and
repeating that every time, he counted up to 100 much quicker
than by going straight through the series: he counted up to
ten, then ten again = 20, 3 times 10 = 30, 4 times = 40, and so
on. At this time he did not know one written or printed
figure from another, nor did he know there was such a word
as “multiply;” but, having acquired the power of counting
up to 100 by ten and by 5, he set about, in his own way, to
acquire the multiplication-table: he got a small bag of shot,
which he arranged into squares of 8 on each side, and then,
on counting them, found they amounted to 64; which fact
once established, remained undisturbed in Mr. Bidder’s
mind until this day; and in this way he acquired the whole
multiplication-table up to 10 times 10, which was all he
needed. In a house opposite his father’s lived an aged
blacksmith, who allowed young Bidder to run about his
workshop and blow the bellows for him, and on winter-evenings
to listen to the old man’s stories by the forge-hearth.
By practice his powers of numeration were drawn forth, he
was rewarded with halfpence, and thus he became more
attached to arithmetic. The “Calculating Boy” has now
matured as an eminent engineer; the process of reasoning,
or action of the mind, by which, when a boy, he trained
himself in Mental Arithmetic, having laid the basis of sound
professional skill, which he has most beneficially exercised
in various great engineering works.</p>

<p class='c021'>James Walker, civil engineer, who died in 1862, aged
eighty-one, was the oldest member of the profession. He
was one of the earliest members of the Institution of Civil
Engineers, succeeded Telford as President, and filled the
chair fourteen years. Mr. Walker, through his long life,
was associated with many of the greatest hydraulic works
in England and Scotland, including lighthouses, harbours,
bridges, embankments, and drainage. He had accumulated
in personalty 300,000<i>l.</i>, which he took great pains to distribute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>by his will; for he was a kind-hearted, generous man,
and considerate and liberal to those associated with him in
his profession.</p>

<p class='c021'><a href='#r100'>100</a>. He had more perilous escapes from violent death than fall to the lot of
most men. He had two narrow escapes from drowning by the river suddenly
bursting in upon the Thames-Tunnel works. During the Great Western Railway
inspection, he was one day riding a pony rapidly down Boxhill, when the
animal stumbled and fell, pitching the engineer on his head; he was taken up
for dead, but eventually recovered. One day, when driving an engine through
the Box-tunnel, he discerned some light object standing on the same line
of road along which his engine was travelling; he turned on the full steam
and dashed the object (a contractor’s truck) into a thousand pieces. When on
board the <i>Great Western</i> steam-ship, he fell down a hatchway into the hold, and
was nearly killed. But the most extraordinary accident which befel him was,
in showing a sleight-of-hand trick to his children, his swallowing a half-sovereign,
which dropped into his windpipe, remained there for six weeks, when it
was removed through an incision in the windpipe, by Sir Benjamin Brodie and
Mr. Key; his body was inverted, and after a few coughs, the coin dropped into
his mouth. Mr. Brunel used afterwards to say, that the moment when he heard
the gold piece strike against his upper front teeth was perhaps the most exquisite
in his whole life.—Abridged from the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, No. 223.</p>

strata to consist of gravel and clay of inconsiderable depth, the clay he removed

he converted this spot from one of the most unhealthy to one of the most
healthy—a singular adaptation of the means to the end.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SCIENTIFIC FARMING.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Southey, in <i>The Doctor</i>, remarks: “It is a fact not unworthy
of notice, that the most intelligent farmers in the
neighbourhood of London are persons who have taken to
farming as a business, because of their strong inclination
for rural employments: one of the very best in Middlesex,
when the Survey of that county was published by the Board
of Agriculture, had been a tailor.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Scientific farming has of late years largely multiplied
these amateur farmers; but, long before rural economy had
taken this turn, we remember a curious instance. Some
five-and-forty years since, when Davy’s <i>Agricultural Chemistry</i>
was the only work of its class, there lived in a town of Surrey
a gentleman-tradesman, who loved to relieve the monotony
of his own business by flying off to experimental pursuits.
In politics he was a disciple of Cobbett, and year after year
foretold a revolution in England,—an alarm which he raised
throughout his household. He took extreme interest in
new mechanical projects; and kept a chronological record
of the progress of the Thames Tunnel. In wine-making he
was a very experimentalist, and knew by heart every line
of Macculloch on Wine from unripe fruit. Next, he turned
over every inch of his garden, analysed the soil <i>à la Davy</i>,
and <i>salted</i> all his growing crops, as well as the soil. But
he soon flew from horticultural chemistry to real farming;
and about the same time took to road-making and macadamisation,
and became surveyor of the highways. He next
bought the lease of a house in the neighbourhood for the
sake of the large garden attached to it; and here he passed
much of his time in its experimental culture. Had he lived
to the days of Liebig, how he would have revelled in his
theories!</p>

<p class='c021'>We have a strong confirmation of Southey’s remark in
the present day in the case of Alderman Mechi, who has
become a memorable man in this kind of experimental
agriculture, and has transferred the <i>magic</i> of his Razor-Strop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>(by the sale of which, in ten years he realised a handsome
fortune) to the barren heath-land of Essex. In 1840 he commenced
his bucolic experiments by purchasing a small unproductive
farm at Tiptree-heath; and here he tried what
could be effected by deep drainage and the application of
steam-power. The Essex farmers laughed at him as an
enthusiast, and the country gentlemen kept aloof from him.
Mechi, however, persevered, and brought his farm into such
high productiveness that he realises annually an average
handsome profit. We have seen his balance-sheet impugned:
however, if public opinion is worth any thing, he has rendered
great service to agricultural science by the exhibition
of processes upon his model farm, Tiptree, which is
known all over the European continent; for the Alderman
has been presented with a 500<i>l.</i> testimonial of plate by
noblemen and gentlemen interested in science and agriculture
at home and abroad.</p>

<hr class='c027' />

<h3 class='c012'>LARGE FORTUNES.</h3>

<p class='c023'>No single class can be pointed to in the present day
as the first favourite of fortune. The loan-monger is still
powerful, and so is the speculator; but bankers accumulate
fortunes like those of the highest nobles, and a linen-draper
left the other day cash which would purchase the fee-simple
of the Woburn estates. The rate of fortunes has enormously
increased. Pitt thought it useless to tax fortunes above a
million, and now men die every day whose heirs chuckle over
the saving produced by this want of foresight. A “plum”
has ceased to be even a citizen’s goal, and there are tradesmen
in London whose incomes while in trade exceed “a great
fortune” of the time of the second George. Very enormous
realised fortunes, properties that are producing 50,000<i>l.</i> a-year,
are, however, still very scarce. Only fifty-seven are
returned to the English income-tax; and though that is a
palpably erroneous account, it may be doubted if there are
a dozen individuals with that amount in the world. There
are none in France or Italy beyond a few working capitalists,
a few remaining in Germany, a considerable number
in Russia, and perhaps thirty individuals in America. There
are perhaps ten private incomes in India of that amount,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>as many in South America, and a few officials in the Eastern
world accumulate very considerable sums; but there the
list ends.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c025'><sup>[103]</sup></a> Yet, how often are large fortunes wrecked by
those who succeed to them!</p>

<p class='c021'>Many a Londoner past middle age may recollect Thomas
Clark, “the King of Exeter ’Change,” who was long one of
the most singular characters in the metropolis. He took a
stall in the ’Change in 1765, with 100<i>l.</i> lent him by a stranger.
By parsimony and perseverance he so extended his
business as to occupy nearly one-half of the entire building
with the sale of cutlery, turnery, &amp;c. He grew rich, and
once returned his income at 6000<i>l.</i> a-year. He was penurious
in his habits: he dined with his plate on the bare
board, and his meal, with a pint of porter, never cost him
a shilling; after dinner he took a glass of spirits-and-water
at the public-house opposite the end of the ’Change, and
then returned to his business. He resided in Belgrave-place,
Pimlico; and morning and evening saw him on his
old horse, riding into town and home again—and thus he
figured in the print-shops. He died in 1817, in his eightieth
year, and left nearly half a million of money. His daughter
was married to Hamlet, the celebrated goldsmith of Coventry-street
who, however, met with sad reverses; and, among
other unsuccessful speculations, built the Bazaar and the
Princess’s Theatre in Oxford-street.</p>

<p class='c021'>The wealth of the celebrated Mr. Beckford, the son of
the demagogue Alderman, and Lord Chatham’s god-child,
proved the shoal upon which his happiness was wrecked.
He succeeded to his father’s enormous fortune at ten years
of age. He was educated at home: he was quick and lively,
and had literary tastes; he had a great passion for genealogy
and heraldry; studied Oriental literature: in his seventeenth
year he wrote a history of extraordinary painters.
His father had left him, principally in Jamaica estates, a
property which, on the conclusion of his minority, furnished
him with a million of ready money and an income of 100,000<i>l.</i>
a-year. He travelled and resided abroad until his twenty-second
year, when he wrote <i>Vathek</i>, a work of startling
beauty. At twenty-four he married; but the lady died in
three years. He passed many years in travelling, principally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>in Spain and Portugal, before he got sufficiently settled
in mind to return to his family-seat, Fonthill in Wiltshire.
He began to reside there in 1796, and immediately commenced
the great squandering of his money. He had always
a hundred, and often two hundred, workmen engaged in
carrying out his wayward fancies. But he was haughty
and reserved; and because some of his neighbours followed
game into his grounds, he had a wall, twelve feet high and
seven miles long, built round his home-estate, in order to
shut out the world. He then began the third house at
Fonthill, considering the second too near a piece of water.
The new house was built in a sham monastic style, was
called the Abbey, and cost a quarter of a million; but never
put to any use, except on one occasion, to receive Lord
Nelson. While Beckford was indulging these gigantic follies,
he lost, by an adverse decision in a Chancery-suit, a
considerable portion of his Jamaica property; he was also
cheated out of large sums of money, and in the end was
obliged to sell Fonthill; the purchaser was Mr. Farquhar,
a rich but penurious merchant. In a few years the lofty
tower of the Abbey fell down. The estate is now the property
of the Marquis of Westminster. Mr. Beckford removed
to Bath, and there built, on Lansdowne Hill, an Italian
villa, with a lofty prospect-tower. While residing here
he wrote an account of the travels which he had made half
a century before; and having got through large sums of
money in planting and building, he died in 1844, in his
eighty-fourth year; and upon his tomb a passage from
<i>Vathek</i> is inscribed.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Beckford was unquestionably a man of genius and
rare accomplishments. “But his abilities were overpowered,
and his character tainted, by the possession of wealth so
enormous. At every stage of life his money was like a millstone
round his neck. He had taste and knowledge; but
the selfishness of wealth tempted him to let these gifts of
the mind run to seed in the gratification of extravagant
freaks. He really enjoyed travelling and scenery, but he
felt it incumbent on him, as a millionnaire, to take a French
cook with him wherever he went; and he found that the
Spanish grandees and ecclesiastical dignitaries who welcomed
him so cordially valued him as the man whose cook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>could make such wonderful omelettes. From the day when
Chatham’s proxy stood for him at the font till the day when
he was laid in his pink granite sarcophagus, he was the victim
of riches. Had he had only 5000<i>l.</i> a year, and been sent
to Eton, he might have been one of the foremost men of his
time, and have been as useful in his generation as, under
his unhappy circumstances, he was useless.”<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c025'><sup>[104]</sup></a> It may be
added, that he was worse: for he so threw about his money
at Fonthill as to corrupt and demoralise the simple country-people.
We remember three of his London residences: one
on the Terrace, Piccadilly, on the site of the newly-built
mansion of Baron Rothschild; another of Beckford’s town
residences was No. 1 Devonshire-place, New-road; and the
third, No. 27 Charles-street, May Fair, a very small house,
looking over the garden of Chesterfield-house.</p>

<p class='c021'>The vanity of wealth is exemplified in the following anecdote,
which Mrs. Richard Trench had from an ear-witness:</p>

<p class='c028'>The late Duke of Queensberry, leaning over the balcony of his beautiful
villa near Richmond, where every pleasure was collected which
wealth could purchase or luxury devise, he followed with his eyes the
majestic Thames, winding through groves and buildings of various
loveliness, and exclaimed, “Oh, that wearisome river! Will it never
cease running, running, and I so tired of it?” To me this anecdote
conveys a strong moral lesson, connected with the well-known character
of the speaker, a professed voluptuary, who passed his youth in
pursuit of selfish pleasures, and his age in vain attempts to elude the
relentless grasp of <i>ennui</i>.</p>

<p class='c023'>Now let us turn to some better uses of wealth earned by
well-directed industry. Old Mr. Strahan, the printer (the
founder of the typarchical dynasty), said to Dr. Johnson,
that “there are few ways in which a man can be more
innocently employed than getting money;” and he added,
that “the more one thinks of this, the juster it will appear.”
Johnson agreed with him. Boswell also relates that Mr.
Strahan once talked of launching into the great ocean of
London, in order to have a chance of rising into eminence;
and observing that many men were kept back from trying
their fortunes there because they had been born to a competency,
said, “Small certainties are the bane of men of
talents;” which Johnson confirmed.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Strahan had taken a poor boy from the country as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>an apprentice, upon Johnson’s recommendation. Johnson,
having inquired after him, said, “Mr. Strahan, let me have
five guineas on account, and I’ll give this boy one. Nay,
if a man recommends a boy, and does nothing for him, it’s
sad work. Call him down.” Boswell followed Johnson into
the courtyard behind Mr. Strahan’s house, and there he
heard this conversation:</p>

<p class='c021'>“Well, my boy, how do you go on?” “Pretty well, sir;
but they’re afraid I a’n’t strong enough for some parts of
the business.” <i>Johnson.</i> “Why, I shall be sorry for it; for,
when you consider with how little mental power and corporeal
labour a printer can get a guinea a week, it is a very desirable
occupation for you. Do you hear; take all the pains
you can; and if this does not do, we must think of some
other way of life for you. There’s a guinea.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Here was one of the many instances of Johnson’s active
benevolence. At the same time, says Boswell, the slow and
sonorous solemnity with which, while he bent himself down,
he addressed a little thick short-legged boy, contrasted with
the boy’s awkwardness and awe, could not but excite some
ludicrous emotions.</p>

<p class='c021'>Johnson appears to have been generally alive to the policy
of getting money: we all remember when, as one of the
executors of Mr. Thrale, he was assisting in taking stock
of the brewery in Southwark, how its vastness impressed
the doctor with “the potentiality of growing rich.”</p>

<p class='c021'>William Strahan, a native of Edinburgh, came to London
when a very young man, and worked as a journeyman
printer, having Dr. Franklin for one of his fellow-workmen.
Strahan, industrious and thrifty, prospered, and purchased,
in 1770, a share of the patent for King’s printer; and he
obtained considerable property in the copyrights of the
works of the most celebrated authors of the time. He was
a great friend to Johnson, and kept up his intimacy with
Franklin. He died rich, bequeathing munificent legacies.
He was succeeded in his business by his third son, Andrew
Strahan, who inherited his father’s excellent qualities, and
died in 1831, aged eighty-three, leaving property to the
amount of more than a million of money. Among his many
generous acts, he presented to James Smith, one of the
authors of the <i>Rejected Addresses</i>, the munificent gift of 1000<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>The vicissitudes of the Buckinghams, political as well as
fiscal, can be traced through the long lapse of eight centuries.
In our own times, two dukes have fallen from their
high estate into neglect and poverty. Richard, first Duke
of Buckingham and Chandos, lived at Stowe, with princely
magnificence: his expenditure in rare books and works of
art was enormous; and his entertainment of the Royal
Family of France and their numerous retinues, upon one of
his estates, not only drained his exchequer, but burdened
him with debt. Neither Louis XVIII. nor Charles X., however,
took the slightest notice of the obligation they had
incurred,—apparently regarding such imprudent generosity
as the natural acknowledgment of their exceeding merit.
The Duke was, in 1827, compelled to shut up his house and
go abroad, till his large estates could be nursed, so as to
meet the heaviest and most pressing demands.<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c025'><sup>[105]</sup></a> While
abroad, he had a dream, which he has recorded in his <i>Private
Diary</i>, published in 1862. He dreamed that he was at Stowe,
his dear and regretted home: all was deserted—not a soul
appeared to receive him. His good dog met him, licked
his hand, and accompanied him through all the apartments,
which were desolate and solitary,—every room as he
had left it. He met his wife, who told him all his family
were gone, and she alone was left. He awoke with the
distress of the moment, and slept no more that night.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Rumsey Forster, in his piquant historical notice of
Stowe, prefixed to the <i>Priced and Annotated Catalogue</i>, relates
that, Louis Philippe being present when the Royal
Family of France were enjoying the hospitality of the Marquis
of Buckingham at Stowe, as they were seated together
in the library, the conversation turned on events then enacting
on the other side of the Channel; upon which Louis
Philippe, recollecting his own position with the Revolutionists,
threw himself upon his knees, and begged pardon of
his royal uncle for having ever worn the tricoloured cockade.
The anecdote is curious, when the subsequent career of the
ex-monarch is borne in mind.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Duke died Jan. 17, 1839, and was succeeded by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>only son, Richard Plantagenet, who, though crippled in
fortune by the paternal tastes, celebrated the coming of age
of his son with profuse hospitality at Stowe, in 1844; and
in 1845, entertained Queen Victoria and the Prince Albert
with great sumptuousness. The mansion at Stowe was
partly refurnished for the occasion, when the cost of the new
carpets was 5000<i>l.</i> In 1848, the dream of the first Duke
was strangely realised by the dismantling of Stowe, and the
compulsory dispersion of the whole of the costly contents;
the sale occupying forty days, and realising 75,562<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
The Duke subsequently resided in the neighbourhood; and
he often indulged his sadness at his fallen fortunes by walking
to Stowe; and there, in one of the superb saloons in
which kings and princes had held courts and been feasted
with regal magnificence,—seated in a chair before a small
table—the only furniture in the room—would Richard Plantagenet
pass many an hour of “bitter fancy.” He died
July 30, 1861, at the age of sixty-four. Sir Bernard Burke,
Ulster, writes of the Duke’s lineage: “Of all native-born
British subjects, his Grace was, after the present reigning
family, the senior representative of the Royal Houses of
Tudor and Plantagenet.”<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c025'><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>“Day and Martin’s Blacking,” one of the inventions of
the present century, realised a large fortune, which was
mostly appropriated to beneficent purposes. Day is related
to have been originally a hair-dresser; and, as the story
goes, one morning a soldier entered his shop, representing
that he had a long march before him to reach his regiment;
that his money was gone, and nothing but sickness, fatigue,
and punishment awaited him unless he could get a lift on a
coach. The worthy barber, who, with his small means, was a
generous man, presented him with a guinea, when the grateful
soldier exclaimed, “God bless you, sir! how can I ever
repay you this? I have nothing in this world except” (pulling
a dirty piece of paper from his pocket) “a receipt for
blacking: it is the best ever was seen; many a half-guinea
have I had for it from the officers, and many bottles have I
sold.” Mr. Day, who was a shrewd man, inquired into the
truth of the story, tried the blacking, and finding it good,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>commenced the manufacture and sale of it, and realised
the immense fortune of which he died possessed in 1836;
bequeathing 100,000<i>l.</i> for the benefit of persons who, like
himself, suffered the deprivation of sight. The rebuilding of
the Blacking Factory, in High Holborn, cost 12,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c021'>Pianoforte-making has led to great money-making results.
About the year 1776, Becker, a German, undertook to apply
the pianoforte mechanism to the harpsichord, assisted by
John Broadwood and Robert Stodart, then workmen in the
employ of Burckhardt Tschudi, of Great Pulteney-street,
London. After many experiments, the grand-pianoforte
mechanism was contrived by these three. Messrs. Broadwood,
from 1824 to 1850, made on an average 2236 pianofortes
per annum; and employed in their manufactory 573
workmen, besides persons working for them at home. In
1862 died the head of the firm, Mr. Thomas Broadwood,
sen., at the age of seventy-five, leaving 350,000<i>l.</i> personal
property, besides realty.</p>

<p class='c021'>James Morison, who styled himself “the Hygeist,” and
was noted for his “Vegetable Medicines,” was a Scotchman,
and a gentleman by birth and education. His family
was of the landed gentry of Aberdeenshire, his brother
being “Morison of Bognie,” an estate worth about 4000<i>l.</i> a
year. In 1816 James Morison, having sold his commission,
for he was an officer in the army, lived in No. 17 Silver-street,
Aberdeen, a house belonging to Mr. Reid, of Souter
and Reid, druggists. He obtained the use of their pill-machine,
with which he made in their back-shop as many
pills as filled two large casks. The ingredients of these
pills, however he may have modified them afterwards, were
chiefly oatmeal and bitter aloes. With these two great
“meal bowies” filled with pills, he started for London;
with the fag-end of his fortune advertised them far and
wide, and ultimately amassed 500,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p class='c021'>Such is the statement of a Correspondent of the <i>Athenæum</i>.
Morison’s own story was, that his own sufferings
from ill-health, and the cure he at length effected upon
himself by “vegetable pills,” made him a disseminator of
the latter article. He had found the pills to be “the only
rational purifiers of the blood;” of these he took two or
three at bedtime, and a glass of lemonade in the morning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>and thus regained sound sleep and high spirits, and feared
neither heat nor cold, dryness nor humidity. The duty on
the pills produced a revenue of 60,000<i>l.</i> to Government
during the first ten years. Morison died at Paris, in 1840,
aged seventy.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Denisons, father and son, accumulated two of the
largest fortunes of our time. About 120 years ago, Joseph
Denison, who was the son of a woollen-cloth merchant
at Leeds, anxious to seek his fortune in London, travelled
thither in a wagon, being attended on his departure
by his friends, who took a solemn leave of him, as the distance
was then thought so great that they might never see
him again. He at first accepted a subordinate situation;
but being industrious, parsimonious, and fortunate, he
speedily advanced himself in the confidence and esteem of
his employers, bankers in St. Mary Axe, and married successively
two wives with property. He continued to prosper;
and by joining the Heywoods, eminent bankers of
Liverpool, his wealth rapidly increased. In 1787 he purchased
the estate of Denbies, near Dorking in Surrey. By
his second wife he had one son, William Joseph Denison;
and two daughters—Elizabeth, married, in 1794, to Henry,
first Marquis Conyngham; and Maria, married, in 1793, to
Sir Robert Lawley, Bart., created, in 1831, Baron Wenlock.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Denison died in 1806; his son, succeeding to the banking
business, continued to accumulate; and, at his death
in his seventy-ninth year, in August 1849, left two millions
and a half of money. He had sat in Parliament for Surrey
from 1818. He was a man of cultivated tastes, possessed a
knowledge of art and elegant literature; he feared to be
thought ostentatious, and could with difficulty be prevailed
on to have a lodge erected at the entrance to a new road
which he had just formed on his estate, near Dorking. The
Marchioness Conyngham was left a widow in 1832; she died
in 1861, having attained the venerable age of ninety-two,
and lived to see both her sons peers of the realm,—the one
in succession to his father; the second, Albert Denison, as
heir to her own brother’s great fortune and estates, with
the title of Baron Londesborough.</p>

<p class='c021'>The career of George Hudson, ridiculously styled “the
Railway King,” was one of the <i>ignes fatui</i> of the railway
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>mania. He was born in a lowly house in College-street,
York, in 1800; here he served his apprenticeship to a linendraper,
and subsequently carried on the business as principal,
amassing considerable wealth. His fortune was next
increased by a bequest from a distant relative, which sum
he invested in North-Midland Railway shares; and, under
his chairmanship, they gradually rose from 70<i>l.</i> discount to
120<i>l.</i> premium. This led to the creation of new shares in
branch and extension lines, often worthless, which were
issued at a premium also: Hudson soon found himself
chairman of 600 miles of railway, extending from Rugby to
Newcastle; and he is stated in a single day to have cleared
100,000<i>l.</i> He was also elected M.P. for Sunderland; and
served twice Lord Mayor of York. The sum of 16,000<i>l.</i> was
subscribed and presented to him as a public testimonial;
with which he purchased a mansion at Albert-gate, Hyde-park;
here he lived sumptuously, and went his round of
visits among the peerage. But the speculation of 1845 was
followed by a sudden reaction: shares fell, the holders sold
to avoid payment of calls, and many were ruined; then
followed the unkingship of Hudson, who was hurled down
like the molten calf, and he lost a vast fortune in the general
wreck of the railway bubbles.</p>

<p class='c021'>The most beneficial fortunes made in business are those
by which, at the same time, permanent advantages are secured
to the public. Henry Colburn, the well-known publisher,
“was a man of much ability and extraordinary enterprise.
His public career connected him intimately with the
literature of the present century, and few are the distinguished
writers, during the last forty years, whose names
were not associated with that of Mr. Colburn. In one of Mr.
Disraeli’s novels a handsome tribute is paid to his acuteness
of judgment and generosity of dealing. The publication of
the Diaries of Pepys and Evelyn will rank among many
sterling contributions to literature due in the first instance
to his enterprise. He originated those weekly literary reviews
which have since been so successful; he established
more than one newspaper, and conducted for a great many
years the Magazine which still bears his name; and was
the original publisher of Sir Bernard Burke’s <i>Peerage</i>. In
private life he was known as a friendly, hospitable, kind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>man, and acts of the greatest liberality marked his course
through life.”<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c025'><sup>[107]</sup></a> He died at an advanced age.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. James Morrison, the wealthy warehouseman of Cripplegate,
started in life as foreman to Mr. Todd, whose daughter
he married; and succeeding to his large property, distinguished
himself as a sound political economist, and for
some years sat in Parliament. He obtained, by purchase,
the fine estates of Basilden, in Berkshire, and Fonthill, in
Wiltshire: at Basilden, in 1846, the Lord Mayor and Corporation,
upon the View of the Thames, were entertained by
Mr. Morrison, who then referred with much gratification to
his having been brought up in the City of London, “connected
with it in a mercantile point of view, and having, by
his own industry, obtained every thing he could desire.”
He was a man of high commercial character; to which Mr.
Edwin Chadwick, at the Meeting of the British Association
at Cambridge, in 1862, bore this interesting testimony: “I
had the pleasure,” said Mr. Chadwick, “of the acquaintance
of perhaps the most wealthy and successful merchant of the
last half-century,—a distinguished member of our political
economy club, the late Mr. James Morrison,—who assured
me, that the leading principles to which he owed his success
in life, and which he vindicated as sound elements of economical
science, were—always to consult the interests of
the consumer, and not, as is the common maxim, to buy
cheap and sell dear, but to sell cheap as well as to buy
cheap; it being to his interest to widen the area of consumption,
and to sell quickly and to the many. The next
maxim is involved in the first principle—always to tell the
truth, to have no shams: a rule which he confessed he found
it most difficult to get his common sellers to adhere to in
its integrity, yet most important for success, it being to his
interest as a merchant that any ship-captain might come
into his warehouse and fill his ship with goods of which he
had no technical knowledge, but of which he well knew that
only a small profit was charged upon a close ready-money
purchasing price, and that go where he would he would find
nothing cheaper; it being, moreover, to the merchant’s interest
that his bill of prices should be every where received
from experience as a truth, and trustworthy evidence so far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>of a fair market-value. I might cite extensive testimony of
the like character to show that the very labour and risks of
continued deceits, however common, are detrimental to the
successful operation of economic principles, and that sound
economy is every where concurrent with high public morality.”</p>

<p class='c021'>With this brilliant exception before us, we must, however,
admit the general truth of this experience: “The
nobility of trade usually ends with the second generation.
A thrifty and persevering man falls into a line of business
by which he accumulates a large fortune, preserving through
life the habits, manners, and connexions of his trade; but
his children, brought up with expectations of enjoying his
property, understand only the art of spending. Hence,
when deprived of fortune, without industry or resources,
they die in beggary, leaving a third generation to the same
chances of life as those with which their grandfather began
his career fourscore years before.”<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c025'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>CIVIC WORTHIES.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The state and dignity of the office of Chief Magistrate
of the City of London have, during nearly centuries of its
existence, pointed many a moral,—from the nursery-tale of
Whittington to the accessories of Hogarth’s pictures and a
homelier illustration of our own days:</p>

<p class='c028'>Our Lord Mayor and his golden coach, and his gold-covered footmen
and coachman, and his golden chain, and his chaplain, and great
sword of state, please the people, and particularly the women and girls;
and when they are pleased, the men and boys are pleased: and many
a young fellow has been more industrious and attentive from his hope
of one day riding in that golden coach.—<i>Cobbett.</i></p>

<p class='c023'>This is, however, but the bright side of the picture. Civic
office is often a costly honour; not only by large expenditure,
but by neglect of private business to attend to the
public duties of the station.</p>

<p class='c021'>All that we propose to do here is to record a few noteworthy
Mayoralties of the <i>present century</i>, to show that the
office continues to be filled by men of high character and
moral worth.</p>

<p class='c021'>Among the worthy citizens should be mentioned Sir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>James Shaw, born in 1764, in the humblest circumstances,
and educated at the grammar-school of Kilmarnock. He
settled in London as a merchant, by his own perseverance
and integrity amassed a fortune, served as Lord Mayor
1805-6, sat in three parliaments for the City, and was subsequently
Chamberlain. He was unostentatiously charitable,
encouraged industrious poor men, and succoured the indigent,
because he remembered his own unpromising infancy;
and he was one of the first to assist the helpless children
of Robert Burns. In commemoration of these estimable
qualities, a marble statue of Sir James Shaw was erected by
public subscription at Kilmarnock in 1848.</p>

<p class='c021'>Sir Matthew Wood, Bart., the most popular Lord Mayor
in the present century, began life as a druggist’s traveller,
and then settled in London in the ward of Cripplegate,
for which he rose to be alderman: he served as Lord Mayor
two successive years, and represented the City in nine parliaments;
his baronetcy was the first title conferred by
Queen Victoria shortly after her accession. He gained much
popularity as the adviser of the ill-fated Queen Caroline;
for which, and his general political conduct, a princely
legacy was bequeathed to him by the wealthy banker of
Gloucester of the same name. He died in his 75th year:
his eldest son, the present baronet, is in holy orders; and
his second son, Sir William Page Wood, is a sound equity
lawyer and a Vice-Chancellor.</p>

<p class='c021'>Alderman Birch, Lord Mayor in 1815, received a liberal
education, and at an early age wrote some poems of considerable
merit: he succeeded his father in business, as a
cook and confectioner, in Cornhill. He produced several
dramatic pieces, of which the <i>Adopted Child</i> is a stock favourite:
he was a sound scholar, and wrote the inscription
for the statue of George III. in the Council-chamber at the
Guildhall, and took an active part in founding the London
Institution.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c025'><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Robert Waithman, Lord Mayor in 1823-24, was born
of parents in humble life, in 1764, and, when a boy, was
adopted by his uncle, a linendraper at Bath, and sent to a
school where the boys were taught public and extemporaneous
speaking. He was taken into his uncle’s business,
and subsequently came to London, and opened a shop at
the south end of Fleet-market. In 1794 he began to take
an active part in City politics, and was next elected into
the Common Council, where his speeches, resolutions, petitions,
and addresses, would fill a large volume. He sat in
five parliaments for the City, made a popular Sheriff and
Lord Mayor; and after his death, in 1833, his friends and
fellow-citizens erected to his memory a granite obelisk upon
the site whereon he commenced business. A memorial
tablet was also placed in St. Bride’s church, stating that
“it was his happiness to see that great cause triumphant,
of which he had been the intrepid advocate from youth to
age.” Curiously enough, this tablet is placed in the vestibule
of the church, directly opposite a similar memorial to Mr.
Blades, of Ludgate-hill, who was a fine old Tory, and a stanch
opponent to Waithman throughout his stormy political life:
as in life, so in death the great leveller has laid them here.</p>

<p class='c021'>Waithman made his first political speech at Founders’
Hall, “the caldron of sedition,” when he and his fellow-orators
were routed by constables sent by the Lord Mayor,
Sanderson, to disperse the meeting. When Sheriff, in 1821,
Waithman, in endeavouring to quell a tumult at Knightsbridge,
had a carbine presented at him by a lifeguardsman;
and, at the funeral of Queen Caroline, a bullet passed
through the Sheriff’s carriage, in the procession through
Hyde-park. Latterly, the alderman grew too moderate for
his Farringdon-ward friends, and he was defeated of being
elected Chamberlain; he then withdrew to a farm near
Reigate, and in this bucolic retirement passed away. He
was an intrepid, upright man, but had been sparsely educated;
and many of the Resolutions on the War with France,
by which he gained political notoriety, were written by his
friend and neighbour, Sir Richard Phillips.</p>

<p class='c021'>In early life Waithman showed considerable genius for
acting; and we once heard him relate that his success in
the character of Macbeth led his friends to press upon him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>the stage as a profession; but he chose another sphere. He
was uncle to John Reeve, the clever comic actor.</p>

<p class='c021'>Alderman Kelly, Lord Mayor at the accession of her
Majesty in 1837, was horn at Chevening, in Kent, and lived,
when a youth, with Alexander Hogg, the publisher, in Paternoster-row,
for 10<i>l.</i> a year wages. He slept under the shop-counter
for the security of the premises; but was reported
to his master to be “too slow” for the situation: Mr. Hogg,
however, thought him “a biddable boy,” and he remained:
this incident shows <i>upon what apparently trifling circumstances
a man’s future prospects in life depend</i>. Kelly succeeded Mr.
Hogg in the business, became alderman of the ward, and
lived upon the spot sixty years: he died in his eighty-fourth
year.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c025'><sup>[110]</sup></a> He was a man of active benevolence, and reminded
one of the pious Lord Mayor, Sir Thomas Abney.</p>

<p class='c021'>Sir Chapman Marshall, Lord Mayor 1839-40, was also
of humble origin, as he narrated in 1831, when Sheriff, in
replying to the toast of his health: “My Lord Mayor and
gentlemen, you now see before you a humble individual who
has been educated in a parochial school. I came to London
in 1803, without a shilling—without a friend. I have not
had the advantage of a classical education; therefore you
will excuse my defects of language. But this I will say, my
Lord Mayor and gentlemen, that you witness in me what
may be done by the earnest application of honest industry;
and I trust my example may induce others to aspire,
by the same means, to the distinguished situation which I
now have the honour to fill.” Here is a similar instance.</p>

<p class='c021'>Sir John Pirie, Lord Mayor 1841-2, received his baronetcy
on the christening of the Prince of Wales: at his
inauguration dinner Sir John said: “I little thought, forty
years ago, when I came to the City of London, a poor lad
from the banks of the Tweed, that I should ever arrive at
so great a distinction.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Alderman Wire, Lord Mayor 1858-9, was born 1801, and
was one of the large family of a tradesman at Colchester;
yet he had the advantage of a liberal education. He came
to London and articled himself to a City solicitor, and by
his intelligence and industry was advanced to be partner in
the business, and ultimately became the head of the firm. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>was elected Alderman of his Ward (Walbrook), served Sheriff
in 1853, and then Lord Mayor. Early in his year of office
he was afflicted with paralysis, of which he recovered; but
died on Lord-Mayor’s-day 1860! He was an active advocate
of sanitary and educational movements, a liberal politician,
and a man of cultivated taste, and made an able
chief magistrate.</p>

<p class='c021'>Alderman Mechi deserves a niche among these civic worthies,
by the superior enterprise of his career. He is the son
of a citizen of Bologna, was brought to England by his father,
and, obtaining a clerkship in a house in the Newfoundland
trade, he remained there eleven years. Whilst in this service,
he turned the hour allowed for dinner to profitable account
by selling, among his friends and acquaintance in the City,
a small and inexpensive article, of which he had bought the
patent. Mainly by these exertions, when in his twenty-fifth
year, he commenced business as a cutler, with the success we
have already intimated. He then studied how to remedy the
defects of English farming by scientific processes; rose to be
Sheriff and an Alderman; took an active part in the affairs of
the Society of Arts, and was specially sent by her Majesty’s
Government to the Industrial Exhibition at Paris in 1854.</p>

<p class='c021'>Addison, we know, says, “the City has always been the
province for satire; and the wits of King Charles’s time
jested upon nothing else during his whole reign.” Nevertheless,
“the Merry Monarch” dined with the citizens no
fewer than nine times in their Guildhall. Here also Whittington
had feasted Henry V. and his Queen, when he threw
the King’s bonds for 60,000<i>l.</i> into a fire of spice-wood. But
a still more memorable feast was that in 1497, when at the
table of the Lord Mayor, William Purchase, Erasmus first
met Sir Thomas More; whence sprung one of the most interesting
friendships in literary history.</p>

<p class='c021'>It has been well said that a dinner lubricates business;
and it does more—it fosters charity and good works. The
annual banquet on Lord-Mayor’s-day, in the Guildhall, is
mostly to be viewed as a festival of civic state: “the loving-cup
and the barons of beef carrying the mind back to medieval
times and manners.”<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c025'><sup>[111]</sup></a> The banquets at the Mansion
House—one of the most palatial edifices in the kingdom—are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>of a like stately description; and for the more direct
benefits of civic festivity we must look to the Ward dinners,
and the meetings of public officers at table, when they forget
the cares and heartburnings incident to every grade of
office, and enjoy with the feast the higher luxury of doing
good.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f109'>
<p class='c021'><a href='#r109'>109</a>. Birch excelled in his art; and his <i>cuisine</i> was unrivalled in the City.
Kitchiner immortalised his soups in print, and the Mansion-House banquets
and Court dinners of the Companies attested the alderman’s practical skill in his
business. The shop in Cornhill was established in the reign of King George I.
by Horton, who was succeeded by the father of Alderman Birch, whose successors,
in 1836, were the present proprietors, Ring and Brymer. The premises
present a curious specimen of the decorated shop-front of the early part of the
last century.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WORKING AUTHORS AND ARTISTS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Godwin, the novelist and political writer, used to say
that an author should have two heads,—one for his books,
the other for worldly matters. And Holcroft, Godwin’s contemporary,
made a similar remark on actors,—that they
were so often filling other characters as to forget their own.
These observations are, happily, of rare application in the
cases of the present day.</p>

<p class='c021'>We, however, remember the phrase of <i>Grub-street</i> in occasional
use, and we find “the poor devil of an author” in
one of Washington Irving’s early works. But this species
is now extinct; and authors build villas, give large parties,
and keep carriages, like other successful professional men.
Nor must it be forgotten that they do not receive their
money for corrupt services, as did the hacks of former days;
and a Grub-street Author would be now almost as great a
rarity as a living gorilla.</p>

<p class='c021'>We remember a specimen of “author and rags—author
and dirt—author and gin,”—of forty years since. He lived
in a garret,<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c025'><sup>[112]</sup></a> in an old house at the top of Red Lion-court,
Fleet-street: in one corner of the room, upon the floor, lay
the bed; near the fire-place was an old chair; a box placed
endwise served for a table; and these, with an almost spoutless
coffee-pot, a maimed cup and saucer, a bottle for a candlestick,
and an old chest, nearly completed the contents of
the miserable apartment. The inmate was an old man turned
of seventy, with shrunk shanks and loosely-fitting coat and
breeches, and the conventional author’s-nightcap; his scratchwig
being placed upon one of the uprights of his chair, which
served as a block. Every portion of the room bore evidence
of the <i>dirt;</i> and the atmosphere was redolent of <i>gin</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>He wrote a large black, sermon-like hand, upon paper of
all sorts and sizes: his matter was as antiquated as his
manner; his very talk was scholastic pedantry, and the
room was strewed with scraps and shreds of his learning:
but he lived within the classic shade of Valpy’s printing-office.
With all his labour and learning, whatever he wrote
was not half so serviceable or so interesting as a short-hand
report of an occurrence of yesterday.</p>

<p class='c021'>Another humble practitioner of authorship had been
driven to it by failure in business; and an undecided Chancery-suit
had made him a pitiable, puling fellow; far less
cheerful than the evergreen “Tom Hill,” who, failing as a
drysalter at unlettered Queenhithe, betook himself to the
editorship of the <i>Monthly Mirror</i>, but had to part with a
collection of book-rarities (chiefly English poetry), which he
began to make in early life as some relief to drysalting,
which was any thing but Attic work!</p>

<p class='c021'>The life of this “merry bachelor” exemplified one venerable
proverb, and disproved another: born in 1760, and
dying in 1840, he was “as old as the Hills,” having led a
long life and a merry one. He was a remarkably early riser;
but that which contributed more to his longevity was his
gaiety of heart, and his being merry and wise: he had his
cares and crosses, but when nearly ruined by an adverse
speculation in indigo, he retired with the remains of his
property to chambers in the Adelphi. His books were
valued at 6000<i>l.</i> He had been a Mecænas in his time, and
had patronised two friendless poets, Bloomfield and Kirke
White. He was the Hull of his friend Theodore Hook’s
<i>Gilbert Gurney</i>, and suggested some of the eccentricities of
Paul Pry.</p>

<p class='c021'>Authorship and Trade are thought to be “wide as the poles
asunder,” though sometimes attempered by circumstances.
David Booth, who wrote the <i>Analytical Dictionary</i> and a
critical work on English Composition, was originally a
brewer, then a man of letters; and late in life he realised
much money by imparting to brewers the secret of preventing
Acidification in Brewing.</p>

<p class='c021'>Among the strange successes of authorship may be mentioned
the popularity of works published anonymously,
which their authors have not cared to claim. The accomplished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Dr. William Maginn wrote the tragic story of the
Polstead murder, in 1827, in the form of a novel, entitled
the <i>Red Barn</i>, the sale of which extended to many thousand
copies; yet no one suspected it to be the work of an elegant
scholar, critic, and poet.</p>

<p class='c021'>Literary Fame, Lord Byron affected to despise, in the
following entry in his entertaining <i>Ravenna Journal</i>, January
4th, 1821:</p>

<p class='c028'>I was out of spirits—read the papers—thought what <i>fame</i> was, on
reading in a case of murder that Mr. Wych, grocer, at Tunbridge, sold
some bacon, flour, cheese, and, it is believed, some plums, to some
gipsy woman accused. He had on his counter (I quote faithfully) a
book, the <i>Life of Pamela</i>, which he was <i>tearing</i> for <i>waste</i> paper, &amp;c. &amp;c.
In the cheese was found, &amp;c., and a <i>leaf</i> of <i>Pamela wrapped round the
bacon</i>. What would Richardson, the vainest and luckiest of <i>living</i>
authors (<i>i. e.</i> while alive)—he who, with Aaron Hill, used to prophesy
and chuckle over the presumed fall of Fielding (the prose Homer of
human nature), and of Pope (the most beautiful of poets)—what would
he have said could he have traced his pages from their place on the
French prince’s toilets (see Boswell’s <i>Johnson</i>) to the grocer’s counter
and the gipsy murderess’s bacon? What would he have said—what can
any body say—save what Solomon said long before us. After all, it is
but passing from one counter to another—from the bookseller’s to the
other tradesman’s, grocer or pastry-cook. For my part, I have met
with most poetry upon trunks; so that I am apt to consider the trunk-maker
as the sexton of authorship.</p>

<p class='c023'>The Letters of Southey afford some of the most truthful
experiences of an author to be found in any record of human
life and character. At the age of thirty, when struggling with
the world, he wrote thus reverentially:</p>

<p class='c028'>No man was ever more contented with his lot than I am; for few
have ever had more enjoyments, and none had ever better or worthier
hopes. Life, therefore, is sufficiently dear to me, and long life desirable,
that I may accomplish all which I design. But yet, I could be
well content that the next century were over, and my part fairly at an
end, having been gone well through. Just as at school one wished the
school-days over, though we were happy enough there, because we
expected more happiness and more liberty when we were to be our
own masters, might lie as much later in the morning as we pleased,
have no bounds, and do no exercise,—just so do I wish that my exercises
were over, that that ugly chrysalis state were passed through to
which we must all come, and that I had fairly burst my shell, and got
into the new world, with wings upon my shoulders, or some inherent
power like the wishing-cap, which should annihilate all the inconveniences
of space.</p>

<p class='c023'>How lifelike also is the following passage upon Southey’s
meeting his friend and schoolfellow, Combe! “It is about
six years since I saw him. Both he and I have grown into
men with as little change as possible in either; and yet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>after a few minutes, there was a dead weight upon me which
was not to be shaken off. We met with the heartiness of
old and thorough familiarity,—something like a family feeling,—but
it was necessary to go back to school; for the
moment we ceased to be schoolboys there was nothing in
common between us. We had no common acquaintance or
pursuit; and I feel that of all things in the world there is
nothing more mortifying than to meet an old friend from
whom you have had no weaning, and to find your friendship
cut through at the root.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The life of John Britton, the topographer and antiquary,
presents a remarkable instance of a man born to trouble,
yet so successfully struggling with difficulties of all kinds,
as to attain a respectable position in life, and to be honoured
in his declining years with a public testimonial of esteem.
He was born at Kington, Wilts, in 1771: his father, through
failure in trade, became insane; the boy learnt his letters
from a hornbook, but received little further schooling. He
came to London, and, until manhood, worked hard in wine-cellars;
but his health breaking down in this employment,
he engaged himself at fifteen shillings a week as clerk to
an attorney. He had grown fond of reading, but could only
get snatches at book-stalls from books, having no money to
buy them. However, he at length succeeded in getting a few,
read early and late, and made some attempts at authorship,
which led him to an enterprise that may be said to have
indicated his future fortune. He projected publishing a
description of his native county, Wiltshire, and with this
view waited upon the Marquis of Lansdowne, at Bowood,
to solicit his patronage.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c025'><sup>[113]</sup></a> He had neither card nor prospectus;
but he told his early struggles and his love of
reading so artlessly, that the kind-hearted nobleman directed
his librarian to provide young Britton with books
and maps; to allot him a bedroom; and depute a person
to show him over the house and pleasure-grounds. He remained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>at Bowood four days, much of which time he passed
in the well-stored library. All this kindness<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c025'><sup>[114]</sup></a> Mr. Britton
gratefully acknowledges in his Autobiography, adding that,
had he been coldly repulsed by Lord Lansdowne, “it is
probable that the <i>Beauties of Wiltshire</i> would never have appeared
before the public, nor its author become known in
literature.” He wrote, edited, and published nearly one hundred
works, and in this way laboured for some sixty years.
This success we attribute to his great energy of character,
nurtured by the kindness with which he was received
at Bowood; and aided in after-life by qualities which we
rarely see associated in the same individual. Mr. Britton
was not only industrious and persevering, but cheerful
under defeat; his evenness of temper was very remarkable;
yet he was not cold in his attachments. He tells us that
from his boyhood he was ambitious to be in the company of
his elders and superiors in knowledge: we can testify that
he was well-behaved, though not obsequious; well-ordered
and accurate in business and money-matters; always living
within his means, from youth, when he read books in bed
to save the expense of fire,—to his green old age of comfort
in his quiet and elegant home in Burton-street: “years
had not blunted his sympathies, but to the last his heart
overflowed with genial kindness and benevolence;” and he
passed away peacefully and resignedly in his eighty-sixth
year, on New-Year’s-day, 1857. It will thus be seen that
John Britton possessed qualities which, if less striking than
his industry, were equally essential to his success in life,
although they were but fully known to his more immediate
circle of friends and acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c021'>The career of Mr. Britton’s friend and neighbour,
Francis Baily, the astronomer, presents a memorable instance
of a well-spent life, although commenced with a mistake.
He was apprenticed to a London tradesman; but disliking
the business, at the expiration of the term, his taste
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>for science having already been developed, at the age of
one-and-twenty he made a very remarkable tour in the unsettled
parts of North America. Returning to England, he
became a member of the Stock Exchange, wrote some important
papers upon subjects connected with commercial
affairs, and applied himself to astronomy in his leisure-hours.
In 1820 he took a conspicuous part in the foundation
of the Astronomical Society. After realising a competent
fortune, he retired from business, and devoted himself
to his favourite pursuits. He died in 1844, in his
seventieth year, after performing a vast amount of valuable
work, of which his labours in the remodelling of the <i>Nautical
Almanac;</i> in the fixation of the standard of length,
involving more than 1200 hours’ watching the oscillations of
the pendulum; in the determination of the density of the
earth; and in the revision of catalogues of the stars,—were
only a part. He passed away with these memorable words
almost upon his lips: “My life is nearly closed. I leave
life with the same tranquillity and equanimity which I have
generally felt and acted on in my personal intercourse with
friends and strangers. I have been blessed with uninterrupted
health. In short, I have had more than my share
of terrestrial happiness, and leave it, as fulfilling an inscrutable
law of animal nature, with thankfulness and resignation.”
“Among Mr. Baily’s friends,” says Prof. de Morgan,
“there is surely not one who will venture to say positively
that he ever knew <i>a better or a happier man</i>.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The rise of Chantrey, the sculptor, from peasant-life was
nobly earned. He was born in the village of Norton, Derbyshire,
in 1781, of parents in humble circumstances. When
a boy carrying milk to the next town, he would stop to form
grotesque figures of the yellow clay; and he moulded his mother’s
butter on churning-days into various forms. From his
fondness for drawing and modelling he was apprenticed to a
carver and gilder at Sheffield. Thence he came to London,
and began to work at carving in stone, not having received
a single lesson from any sculptor; and he laboured for eight
years without earning 5<i>l.</i> in his profession. At length, a
single bust brought him 12,000<i>l.</i>-worth of commissions, and
he rose to be the first sculptor of his day. He died in 1841,
and was buried in a tomb which he had built for himself in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>the churchyard of his native village, where a granite obelisk
has been raised to his memory. He was ever mindful of
his lowly origin; for when he had become famous, and had
received knighthood, at a party given by his patron, Mr.
Thomas Hope, Sir Francis Chantrey was observed to notice
a piece of carved furniture; on being asked the reason, he
replied, “This was my first work.”</p>

<p class='c021'>It is scarcely possible to name Chantrey without being
reminded of his friend, “honest Allan Cunningham,” who,
born in the county of Dumfries, in 1784, received but scanty
education, and at the age of eleven was apprenticed to a
mason. In the intervals of his laborious occupation, “he
sought knowledge wherever he could obtain it,” and drew
his earliest poetic inspiration from the dear country of Burns—the
wilds of Nithsdale, and the lone banks of the Solway.
Here he earned his daily bread as a common stonemason
until his twenty-sixth year, when he came to London, wavering
between labour and literature. He chose the latter,
in reporting for the newspapers; but, soon tired of its perplexities,
he resumed his first calling, and by a fortunate
opportunity, to which his own excellent character recommended
him, he became foreman of the works of Chantrey,
in which honourable employment he remained until the
sculptor’s death, in 1841. In his intervals of business, by untiring
industry, Allan Cunningham produced a succession
of works noteworthy in the poetry and general literature of
his day. His first poetry was printed in 1807: he also wrote
stirring romances; and in collecting Tradition Tales of the
Scottish Peasantry, by the light of an evening fire, he sweetened
many an hour of remission from daily labour. Later
in life he became a critic of the Fine Arts, and wrote with
amiable feeling, honesty, and candour, and mature and
liberal taste: it was well observed of him in his lifetime:
“He needs no testimony either to his intellectual accomplishments
or his moral worth; nor, thanks to his own
virtuous diligence, does he need any patronage.” His
genius and artistic judgment have been inherited by his
third son, Peter Cunningham, the well-known critic, topographer,
and antiquary.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c025'><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>The greatest author of the present century, whether we
regard the beneficial influence of his writings, or its extent,
is Sir Walter Scott. We have already spoken of his diligence
and economy of time; his characteristics as an author
have been ably sketched as follows:</p>

<p class='c028'>With far less classical learning, fewer images derived from travelling,
inferior information on many historical subjects, and a mind of a
less impassioned and energetic cast than other writers of his time,
Sir Walter is far more deeply read in that book which is ever the
same—the human heart. This is his unequalled excellence: there he
stands, without a rival since the days of Shakspeare. It is to this
cause that his astonishing success has been owing. We feel in his characters
that it is not romance, but real life, which is represented.
Every word that is said, especially in the Scotch novels, is nature itself.
Homer, Cervantes, Shakspeare, and Scott, alone have penetrated to
the deep substratum of character, which, however disguised by the
varieties of climate and government, is at bottom every where the
same; and thence they have found a responsive echo in every human
heart. Every man who reads these admirable works, from the North
Cape to Cape Horn, feels that what the characters they contain are
made to say, is just what would have occurred to themselves, or
what they have heard said by others as long as they lived. Nor is it
only in the delineation of character, and the knowledge of human nature,
that the Scottish novelist, like his great predecessors, is but for
them without a rival. Powerful in the pathetic, admirable in dialogue,
unmatched in description, his writings captivate the mind as much by
the varied excellences which they exhibit, as by the powerful interest
which they maintain. He has carried romance out of the region of
imagination and sensibility into the walks of actual life.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c025'><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c023'>Isaac Disraeli, who died in 1848, at the age of eighty-two,
was “a complete literary character, a man who really
passed his life in his library. Even marriage produced no
change in these habits: he rose to enter the chamber where
he lived alone with his books, and at night his lamp was
ever lit within the same walls.” His father destined him for
business; but this he opposed so strongly as to compose
a long poem against commerce, which he attempted to get
published. In spite of all his father could say or do, young
Disraeli determined to become a literary man. His first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>efforts were in poetry and romance; but he soon found out
that his true destiny was literary history; and in 1790 he
published anonymously <i>Curiosities of Literature</i>, the success
of which led him to devote the remainder of his long life to
literary and historical researches, which he prosecuted partly
in the British Museum, where he was a constant visitor
when the <i>readers</i> were not more than half a dozen daily: he
also worked in his own library, which was very extensive.
His <i>Curiosities</i> reached eleven editions; and in acknowledgment
of his <i>Life and Reign of Charles I.</i> he was made
D.C., &amp;c. by the University of Oxford. He is thus personally
described by his gifted son:</p>

<p class='c028'>He was fair, with a Bourbon nose, and brown eyes of extraordinary
beauty and lustre. He wore a small black-velvet cap, but his white hair
latterly touched his shoulders in curls almost as flowing as in his boyhood.
His extremities were delicate and well formed, and his leg, at
his last hour, as shapely as in his youth, which showed the vigour of
his frame. Latterly he had become corpulent. He did not excel in
conversation, though in his domestic circle he was garrulous. Every
thing interested him; and blind, and eighty-two, he was still as susceptible
as a child. One of his last acts was to compose some verses of
gay gratitude to his daughter-in-law, who was his London correspondent,
and to whose lively pen his last years were indebted for constant
amusement. He had by nature a singular volatility, which never deserted
him. His feelings, though always amiable, were not painfully
deep, and amid joy or sorrow the philosophic vein was ever evident.
He more resembled Goldsmith than any man that I can compare him
to: in his conversation his apparent confusion of ideas ending with some
felicitous phrase of genius, his <i>naïveté</i>, his simplicity not untouched
with a dash of sarcasm affecting innocence—one was often reminded of
the gifted and interesting friend of Burke and Johnson. There was,
however, one trait in which my father did not resemble Goldsmith: he
had no vanity. Indeed, one of his few infirmities was rather a deficiency
of self-esteem.</p>

<p class='c023'>Mr. Disraeli had the pride and happiness to see the
writer of the above, Benjamin Disraeli, not only achieve
high distinction in literature, but become a minister of the
Crown. We remember him in his twenty-fifth year. “Who
is that gentleman with a profusion of hair, whom I so often
see here?” was our inquiry of a publisher in Oxford-street.
“That is young Disraeli,” was the publisher’s reply; “and
he would be glad to execute any literary work for a guinea
or two.” He had already produced a piece of piquant satire,
an <i>Account of the Great World</i>,<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c025'><sup>[117]</sup></a> with a Vocabulary; and
shortly after there was announced for publication a periodical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>to be called <i>The Star-Chamber</i>, to have been edited by
Mr. Disraeli. He published his first novel, <i>Vivian Grey</i>, in
1825; <i>Coningsby</i>, a work of fiction and political history, he
wrote chiefly at Deepdene, in Surrey, the seat of his friend,
Mr. H. T. Hope. Mr. Disraeli entered Parliament in 1837:
he succeeded Lord George Bentinck as the Conservative
leader; was Chancellor of the Exchequer under Lord Derby’s
administrations of 1852 and 1858-9; thus exemplifying that
the highest political honours are attainable in this country
by intellectual qualification for public life.</p>

<p class='c021'>Lord Macaulay, the brilliant essayist, historian, and
orator, exemplifies in his successful career how genius may
be most profitably nurtured by systematic education. Of
quick perception and great power of memory, when a boy
he would tell long stories from the <i>Arabian Nights</i> and
Scott’s novels; but the familiar books of his home were the
Bible, <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>, and a few Cameronian divines; and
he was fond of Scripture phraseology throughout his writings.
He appears to have been a great favourite of Hannah
More, who thought him a little prodigy of acquisition, and
wrote of him, when on a visit to her in his boyhood:</p>

<p class='c028'>The quantity of reading that Tom has poured in, and the quantity
of writing he has poured out, is astonishing. We have poetry for
breakfast, dinner, and supper. He recited all <i>Palestine</i> (Bishop Heber’s
poem), while we breakfasted, to our pious friend, Mr. Whalley, at my
desire, and did it incomparably.... I sometimes fancy I observe a
daily progress in the growth of his mental powers. His fine promise of
mind, too, expands more and more; and, what is extraordinary, he has
as much accuracy in his expression as spirit and vivacity in his imagination.
I like, too, that he takes a lively interest in all passing events,
and that <i>the child</i> is still preserved; I like to see him as boyish as he is
studious, and that he is as much amused with making a pat of butter
as a poem. Though loquacious, he is very docile; and I don’t remember
a single instance in which he has persisted in doing any thing when
he saw we did not approve it. Several men of sense and learning
have been struck with the union of gaiety and rationality in his conversation.</p>

<p class='c023'>More remarkable was the prevoyance of Macaulay’s power
as a writer, which Hannah More almost literally predicted:
he cherished a warm recollection of his obligations to her,
and the influence she had in directing his reading. He
received his peerage in honour of his valuable services to
literature: he will long be remembered by his grasp of
mind, descriptive picturesqueness, strong feeling and vivid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>fancy, life-like portraiture, and marvellous scenic skill. In
his mastery of the art of writing he was unrivalled.</p>

<p class='c021'>It may take the reader by surprise to be told that, astounding
as the career of Lord Brougham has been, the
rise of this distinguished man to the highest honour of the
realm appears to have been predicted thirty years before its
attainment. At the Social Science dinner at the Crystal
Palace, Sydenham, on June 14th, 1862, at which Lord
Brougham presided, Mr. J. W. Napier, Ex-Chancellor of
Ireland, related that he remembered, some years previously,
meeting an old and respected lady in the north of England,
who was present at a party when the first writers in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, including Henry Brougham, dined together
at Edinburgh, after the publication of the Second
Number of the Review (in 1802). On that occasion, the
lady’s husband, Mr. Fletcher, remarked that the writer of
a certain paper in the Review, of which he knew not the
author, was fit to be any thing. Mr. Brougham hearing
this, observed, “What! do you think he is fit to be Lord
Chancellor?” The reply was, “Yes; and I tell you more:
he will be Lord Chancellor;” and the old lady had the happiness
to live thirty years after this, and to see her friend
Lord Chancellor of England. Lord Brougham well remembered
old Mrs. Fletcher, and corroborated the accuracy of
Mr. Napier’s anecdote. Mr. Napier then proposed, in an
affectionate manner, the health of Lord Brougham, whose
answer was, as he said, but a repetition of words he had
spoken thirty years ago elsewhere. But on the present occasion
they were perhaps even more appropriate, and in
themselves singularly beautiful: “When I cease from my
labours, the cause of freedom, peace, and progress will lose
a friend, and no man living will lose an enemy.” The noble
lord was much affected, and it is needless to tell of the
applause which followed the sentiment.</p>

<p class='c021'>Henry Brougham was born in Edinburgh in 1779: his
father was no extraordinary man, but his mother is described
as a woman of talent and delightful character. The
son was educated in Edinburgh, which, in 1857, he declared
in public he looked upon as a very great benefit conferred
on him by Providence. He was <i>dux</i> of the Rector’s class
at the Edinburgh University in 1791; and he was preëminent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>in mathematics and natural philosophy, in law, metaphysics,
and political science. When not more than seventeen,
he contributed to the Royal Society a paper on the
Inflection and Reflection of Light; and next, a paper of
Porisms in the Higher Geometry. He chose the Scottish
Bar as his profession; and, with Horner, Jeffrey, and other
Scottish Whigs, joined the renowned Speculative Society
for the sake of extemporaneous debate. He for some time
edited the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, and was for five-and-twenty
years the most industrious and versatile of the contributors.
In 1808 he was called to the Bar at Lincoln’s Inn, and
began to practise as an English barrister. In 1810 he entered
Parliament, and soon distinguished himself on all the
great questions of the day. His application to law, literature,
and science was alike intense. Sir Samuel Romilly
said, he seemed to have time for every thing; and Sydney
Smith once recommended him to confine himself to only
the transaction of so much business as three strong men
could get through. Hazlitt, in a portrait-sketch taken about
1825, says:</p>

<p class='c028'>Mr. Brougham writes almost as well as he speaks. In the midst of
an election contest he comes out to address the populace, and goes
back to his study to finish an article for the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, sometimes
indeed wedging three or four articles in the shape of <i>rifacimenti</i>
of his own pamphlets or speeches in Parliament in a single
Number. Such indeed is the activity of his mind, that it appears to
require neither repose nor any other stimulus than a delight in its own
exercise. He can turn his hand to any thing, but he cannot be idle.
He is, in fact, a striking instance of the versatility and strength of the
human mind, and also, in one sense, of the length of human life: <i>if we
make good use of our time, there is room enough to crowd almost every art
and science into it</i>.</p>

<p class='c023'>It is now nearly forty years since this was written, and
it is almost as applicable as ever. In 1828, in a debate
in Parliament, Mr. Brougham used the memorable words,
“The schoolmaster is abroad.” He next, in a speech of six
hours’ delivery, moved for an inquiry into the state of the
Law; the Repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, Catholic
Emancipation, and the Charities Commission, were next
advocated by him; and then, Parliamentary Reform, the
Abolition of Punishment of Forgery by Death, Local Courts,
and the Abolition of Slavery. In 1830 he was raised to the
high office of Lord Chancellor. Mechanics’ Institutes, and
the foundation of University College, and the Diffusion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Useful Knowledge, were next advocated by Lord Brougham.
His Chancellorship was brief. But he continued to labour
for the next thirty years in Law Reform and Social Science,
and in aiding the progress of liberal opinion.</p>

<p class='c021'>The universal energy which has marked Lord Brougham
was thus ably summed up, on the publication of his volume
of scientific Tracts, in 1860:</p>

<p class='c028'>If the fact of his scientific researches were less well known, there
would be something quite startling in the announcement of a volume
of mathematical tracts from the hand of a man who has had half a
score of other occupations, each sufficient to engross the whole mind of
an ordinarily constituted mortal. To be great as a circuit leader, all-powerful
as a popular chief, triumphant as a reforming Chancellor—to
be the prominent figure in the Anti-Slavery movement, the promoter
of education, the concocter of law-reforming statutes almost without
number—the statesman of all parties, the citizen of two countries, and
the orator of a thousand platforms—might have sufficed most ambitions,
without the renown of literary success and scientific effort. But,
not content with the public achievements of his life, or the obscure
glory of anonymous literature, Lord Brougham has striven to reproduce
in an English dress the eloquence of Demosthenes, and to correct
the real or supposed errors of no less a philosopher than Newton himself....
Philosophical theories may survive Lord Brougham’s attacks,
and <i>savans</i> may forget his speculations; but generations of Englishmen
will long remember the career of a man who has exhibited in a thousand
forms an amount of mental vitality which it would be difficult to parallel
in the history of the most restless and eager aspirants to the glory
of universal genius.</p>

<p class='c023'>It is impossible to reflect upon the politico-legal position
of Lord Brougham when he sat upon the woolsack, without
remembering that Brougham and Denman, at the trial of
Queen Caroline, attacked with virulence, then generally condemned,
the Prince from whose hands, as sovereign, ten
years later, both received high legal office. This change in
feeling is alike creditable to all.</p>

<p class='c021'>One of the most remarkable men of our day was Professor
Wilson, the Editor of <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i>, in the
pages of which he is thus characterised, from his bust in
the Crystal Palace at Sydenham: he was born at Paisley,
in Scotland, in 1785; and died at Edinburgh, in 1854.</p>

<p class='c028'>The head tells the story of the whole man. It is the head of an
athlete, but an athlete possessing a soul, the grace of Apollo sitting on
the thews of Hercules. Such a man, you would say at once, was none
of your sedentary <i>litterati</i>, who appear to have the cramp in their limbs
whenever they move abroad, but one who could, like the Greeks of
old, ride, run, wrestle, box, dive, or throw the discus at need, or put
the stone like Ulysses himself, or one who could do the same things,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>and in addition to them steer, pull an oar, shoot, fish, follow hounds,
or make a good score at cricket, like a true Briton of modern times,
in spite of all our physical and intellectual degeneracy, about which,
indeed, we have a right to be sceptical, when we know that such an
unmistakable man as Wilson was living in the reign of Queen Victoria.
It is an honour to Scotland that she produced such a critic on Homer,
only second to that which is hers in having produced that poet who, of
all the moderns, has composed poetry the most Homeric—even Walter
Scott.</p>

Marquis’s kindness, he tells us that he left Bowood for Chippenham loaded with
books, and a copy of a large Survey of Wiltshire, in eighteen folio sheets. The
Marquis was a liberal patron of Art, and commenced at Bowood and Shelburne
House the formation of a gallery of modern art; and his fine taste was amply
inherited by his son Henry, the third Marquis, who died at Bowood in January
1863.</p>

<p class='c021'><a href='#r114'>114</a>. We remember a similarly gratifying incident in early life. We had scarcely
reached twenty-one, when we had occasion to wait upon Mr. Chamberlain
Clark, to request of him some particulars of the house of Cowley the poet, at
Chertsey, which was then in Mr. Clark’s tenancy. The bland old Chamberlain
inquired if we had ever written a book; to which the reply was, that we had a
volume of topography in the press. “Then please to put down my name for a
copy,” kindly rejoined the Chamberlain, although the work was merely of local
interest. What kindness in one who was the chastener of refractory apprentices

given life to helpless clay and shapeless stone. Around the body in its windingsheet
were ranged some of the finest casts from the antique that money and
taste could procure. Calm and solemn was the scene. My father kissed the

<h3 class='c012'>WEAR AND TEAR OF PUBLIC LIFE.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The sudden death of Lord George Bentinck, the political
leader, in 1848, in his forty-seventh year, showed how the
most ardent intellect and the noblest frame are alike broken
down by the turmoil of public life. After a late debate in
Parliament he would travel by rail many miles to hunt, and
return in time to attend the sittings of the House in the
evening; throwing a wrapper over his scarlet hunting-coat,
and exercising indefatigably the office of “whipper-in” in
the House, and subsequently leader of “the country party.”
He had during these political avocations continued his attention
to racing and race-horses, declaring on one occasion
that the winning of the Derby was the “blue-ribbon” of the
turf. In August 1848 he retired to Welbeck Abbey for relaxation;
he, however, attended Doncaster races four times
in one week, at which a horse of his own breeding won the
St. Leger stakes, to his great gratification. On September
21st he left Welbeck on foot, soon after four o’clock in the
afternoon, to visit Earl Manvers, at Thoresby-park, and sent
his servants to meet him with a carriage at an appointed
place. He appeared not; the servants became alarmed;
search was made for him; but it was not till eleven at night
that he was found quite dead, lying on a footpath in a meadow
about a mile from the house: his death having been
caused by spasms of the heart. In Cavendish-square has
been set up a colossal statue of this remarkable man: the
pedestal simply bears his name; his political and sporting
celebrity has “waned with time; had the awful circumstances
of his death been inscribed upon the memorial, it would
have been a constant monition—a “siste viator”—of far
greater value than a political monument.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>Home Traits.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c012'>LOVE OF HOME.</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>England</span> is, above all other countries, favourable to individual
industry, and that energy of character which, developed
and well directed, succeeds in the world. Still,
failure neither is nor ever has been rare; and private munificence
and public benevolence have provided “many happy
ports and havens” for those whose evening of life is clouded
with storm. We have visited not a few of these sacred
places—these palaces of philanthropy; we have gone about
their buildings—their noble halls glowing with comfort,
and their tables beaming with good cheer. We have for a
brief hour enjoyed the quiet of these retreats, and thought
how their decayed brethren, jaded with adversity and buffeted
with misfortune, may find here that consolation and repose
which the outside world has denied them. These may
be found in the fellowship of the dining-hall, the social walk
in the garden, and the assembling for worship in the chapel.
All this, however, is but the bright side of this mode of life;
and when the time arrives for the brethren to retire, each
to his solitary chamber, then comes the pang of isolation
from the world—even the ungrateful world! And, perchance,
they look from the casement upon the larger foundation-buildings,
and are by them still more forcibly reminded
that this noble place is <i>not their own</i>—in short,
that it presents not the joys nor the delights which are conveyed
to the sensitive heart by that brief but touching word—<span class='sc'>Home</span>!</p>

<p class='c021'>It is scarcely possible to overrate the importance of this
love of home in our scheme of earthly happiness. Southey
has well observed: “Whatever strengthens our local attachments
is favourable both to individual and national character.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Our home, our birthplace, our native land; think,
for a while, what the virtues are which rise out of the feelings
connected with these words.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Then, how is man, in the loneliness we have referred to,
parted from the sweet solace he most needs in his hour of
woe! Such consolation has been thus picturesquely bodied
forth by one of our happiest writers on domestic life: “As
the vine, which has long twined its graceful foliage about
the oak, and been lifted by it into sunshine, will, when the
hardy plant is rifted by the thunderbolt, cling round it with
its caressing tendrils, and bind up its shattered boughs; so
it is beautifully ordered by Providence, that woman, who is
the mere dependent and ornament of man in his happier
hours, should be his stay and solace when smitten with
sudden calamity; winding herself into the rugged recesses
of his nature, tenderly supporting the drooping head, and
binding up the broken heart.”<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c025'><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>FAMILY PORTRAITS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>We remember reading a humorous sketch entitled, “The
late Mr. Smith,” whose portrait after his death was removed
by his widow to the lumber-room, lest it should be displeasing
to her second husband: occasionally the children would
bring out the portrait, and with a rusty foil run “the ugly
old man” through the eyes.</p>

<p class='c021'>Here we have one of the reasons why family portraits
are so often thrust aside; but there are several others. The
Rev. Mr. Eagles relates the following, in <i>Blackwood’s Magazine:</i>
“I remember, when a boy, walking with an elderly
gentleman, and passing a broker’s stall, there was the portrait
of a fine florid gentleman in regimentals. He stopped
to look at it—he might have bought it for a few shillings.
After he had gone away—‘That,’ said he, ‘is the portrait of
my wife’s great uncle—member for the county, and colonel
of militia: you see how he is degraded to these steps.’
‘Why do you not rescue him?’ said I. ‘Because he left me
nothing,’ was the reply. A relative of mine, an old lady,
hit upon a happy device; the example is worth following.
Her husband was the last of his race, for she had no children.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>She took all the family portraits out of their frames,
rolled up all the pictures, and put them in the coffin with
the deceased.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Sheridan has turned an incident of this class to admirable
account, in his <i>School for Scandal</i>, in the reservation of
Uncle Oliver’s portrait from sale.</p>

<p class='c021'>Sometimes a good picture has unpleasant associations.
“That is an excellent portrait of Ireland, the Shakspeare
forger,” said a collector to a picture-dealer in Wardour-street;
whose ready reply was, “Will you buy it, sir? it is but half
a guinea.” “No,” answered the other; “it would seem either
that I admired Ireland’s dishonest ingenuity, or that I had
been his friend.”</p>

<hr class='c027' />
<h3 class='c012'>HOW TO KEEP FRIENDS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>When Goldsmith once talked to Johnson of the difficulty
of living on very intimate terms with any one with whom
you differed on an important topic, Johnson replied: “Why,
sir, <i>you must shun the subject as to which you disagree</i>. For instance,
I can live very well with Burke; I love his knowledge,
his genius, his diffusion, and effulgence of conversation;
but I would not talk to him of the Rockingham
party.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Helps, in his admirable work, <i>Friends in Council</i>, well
observes: “A rule for living happily with others is to avoid
having stock subjects of disputation. It mostly happens,
when people live much together, that they come to have
certain set topics, around which, from frequent dispute,
there is such a growth of angry words, mortified vanity,
and the like, that the original difference becomes a standing
subject for quarrel; and there is a tendency in all minor
disputes to drift down to it. Again: if people wish to live
well together, they must not hold too much to logic, and
supposing every thing is to be settled by sufficient reason.
Dr. Johnson saw this clearly with regard to married people
when he said, ‘Wretched would be the pair, above all names
of wretchedness, who should be doomed to adjust by reason
every morning all the minute detail of a domestic day.’
But the application should be much more general than he
made it. There is no time for such reasonings, and nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>that is worth them. And when we recollect how two lawyers,
or two politicians, can go on contending, and that
there is no end of one-sided reasoning on any subject, we
shall not be sure that such contention is the best mode for
arriving at truth. But certainly it is not the way to arrive
at good temper.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The most gifted men are least addicted to depreciate
either friends or foes. Dr. Johnson, Mr. Burke, and Mr.
Fox were always more inclined to overrate them; your
shrewd, sly, evil-speaking fellow is generally a shallow person;
and frequently he is as venomous, as false when he
flatters as when he reviles. He seldom praises John but to
vex Thomas.</p>

<hr class='c027' />
<h3 class='c012'>SMALL COURTESIES.</h3>

<p class='c023'>How much politeness and winning of the affections exist
in small courtesies, is well exemplified in the following anecdote
related by a lady of a gentleman who had been the
politest man of his generation. On returning once from
school for the holidays, she had been put under his charge
for the journey. They stopped for the night at a Cornish
inn. Supper was ordered, and soon there appeared a dainty
dish of woodcocks. Her cavalier led her to the board with
the air of a Grandison, and then proceeded to place all the
legs of the birds on her plate. At first, with her school-girl
prejudices in favour of wings and in disfavour of legs and
drumsticks, she felt rather angered at having these (as she
supposed) uninviting and least delicate parts imposed upon
her; but in after years, when gastronomic light had beamed
on her, and the experience of many suppers brought true
appreciation, she did full justice to the memory of the man
who could sacrifice such <i>morceaux</i> as woodcocks’ thighs to
the crude appetite of a girl, and who could thus show his innate
deference for womanhood even in such budding form.</p>

<hr class='c027' />
<h3 class='c012'>LASTING FRIENDSHIPS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The man who ill-naturedly said that the church would
not hold his acquaintance, but the pulpit would contain his
friends, cannot be congratulated upon the disproportion.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“Who is your friend?” is an every-day question, probably
never better answered than in the following forcible and
eloquent rebuke by a modern writer:</p>

<p class='c028'>Concerning the man you call your friend, tell me, will he weep with
you in the hour of distress? Will he faithfully reprove to your face, for
actions which others are ridiculing or censuring behind your back?
Will he dare to stand forth in your defence, when detraction is secretly
aiming its deadly weapons at your reputation? Will he acknowledge
you with the same cordiality, and behave to you with the same friendly
attention, in the company of your superiors in rank and fortune, as
when the claims of pride or vanity do not interfere with those of friendship?
If misfortune and losses should oblige you to retire into a walk
of life in which you cannot appear with the same distinction, or entertain
your friends with the same liberality as formerly, will he still think
himself happy in your society, and, instead of withdrawing himself
from an unprofitable connexion, take pleasure in professing himself
your friend, and cheerfully assist you to support the burden of your
afflictions? When sickness shall call you to retire from the gay and
busy scenes of the world, will he follow you into your gloomy retreat,
listen with attention to your “tale of symptoms,” and minister the
balm of consolation to your fainting spirits? And lastly, when death
shall burst asunder every earthly tie, will he shed a tear upon your
grave, and lodge the dear remembrance of your mutual friendship in
his heart, as a treasure never to be resigned? The man who will <i>not</i>
do all this may be your companion,—your flatterer,—but, depend upon
it, <i>he is not your friend</i>.</p>

<p class='c023'>Southey has left this charming picture of Friendship
which ceases but with existence:</p>

<p class='c028'>It may safely be affirmed that generous minds, when they have once
known each other, never can be alienated as long as both retain the
characteristics which brought them into union. No distance of place
or lapse of time can lessen the friendship of those who are thoroughly
persuaded of each other’s worth. There are even some broken attachments
in friendship, as well as in love, which nothing can destroy, and
it sometimes happens that we are not conscious of their strength till
after the disruption. There are a few persons known to me in years
long past, but with whom I lived in no particular intimacy then, and
have held no correspondence since, whom I could not now meet without
an emotion of pleasure deep enough to partake of pain, and who, I doubt
not, entertain for me feelings of the same kind and degree—whose
eyes sparkle when they hear, and glisten sometimes when they speak
of me, and who think of me, as I do of them, with an affection that
increases as we advance in years. This is because our moral and intellectual
sympathies have strengthened, and because, though far asunder,
we know that we are travelling the same road towards our resting-place
in heaven. “There is such a pleasure as this,” says Cowper,
“which would want explanation to some folks, being perhaps a mystery
to those whose hearts are a mere muscle, and serve only for the
purpose of an even circulation.”<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c025'><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>And Professor Wilson has written these words of sweet
consolation for the loss of friends:</p>

<p class='c028'>Friends are lost to us by removal—for then even the dearest are
often utterly forgotten. But let something that once was theirs suddenly
meet our eyes, and in a moment, returning from the region of the
rising or the setting sun, the friend of our youth seems at our side,
unchanged his voice and his smile; or dearer to our eyes than ever,
because of some affecting change wrought on face and figure by climate
and by years. Let it be but his name written with his own hand on the
title-page of a book; or a few syllables on the margin of a favourite
passage which long ago we may have read together, “when life itself
was new,” and poetry overflowed the whole world; or a lock of <i>her</i> hair
in whose eyes we first knew the meaning of the word “depth.” And
if death hath stretched out the absence into the dim arms of eternity,
and removed the distance away into that bourne from which no traveller
returns—the absence and the distance of her on whose forehead
once hung the relic we adore—what heart may abide the beauty of the
ghost that doth sometimes at midnight appear at our sleepless bed,
and with pale uplifted arms waft over us at once a blessing and a
farewell!</p>

<p class='c023'>It rarely happens that broken friendships can be repaired
or renewed. Mrs. Richard Trench, in her Journal,
relates this remarkable instance of a failure:</p>

<p class='c028'>At last, after an interval of twenty-four years, which succeeded a
tolerably intimate acquaintance of seven weeks, I saw Count Münster
of Hanover again. We met like two ghosts that ought to have been
laid long since. I witnessed the whole process of the difficulty of persuading
him that I was I; and I thought him as much changed in his
degree as he could have found me. When we conversed, all the persons
we referred to were dead and gone; and our interview added another
link in my mind to the chain of proofs that, after a very, very long
interval, neither friends nor acquaintance ought to meet in this world.
He was kindly anxious to renew our acquaintance, and visited me next
day; but still it seemed as if seeing me had renewed some painful
associations.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>TRUE TONE OF POLITE WRITING.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Sir James Mackintosh, who has sometimes been unfairly
characterised as a writer of drawing-room essays, has left
the following able view of what may be termed “the True
Tone of Polite Writing,”—a rare accomplishment even in
these days of assumed facility and literary pretension:</p>

<p class='c028'>When a woman of feeling, fancy, and accomplishment has learned
to converse with ease and grace, from long intercourse with the most
polished society, and when she writes as she speaks, she must write
letters as they ought to be written, if she has acquired just as much
habitual correctness as is reconcilable with the air of negligence. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>moment of enthusiasm, a burst of feeling, a flash of eloquence, may be
allowed; but the intercourse of society, either in conversation or in letters,
allows no more. Though interdicted from the long-continued use
of elevated language, they are not without a resource. There is a part
of language which is disdained by the pedant or the declaimer, and
which both, if they knew its difficulty, would approach with dread; it
is formed of the most familiar phrases and turns in daily use by the
generality of men, and is full of energy and vivacity, bearing upon it
the marks of those keen feelings and strong passions from which it
springs. It is the employment of such phrases which produces what
may be called colloquial eloquence. Conversation and letters may be
thus raised to any degree of animation, without departing from their
character. Any thing may be said, if it be spoken in the tone of society.
The highest guests are welcome if they come in the easy undress of the
club: the strongest metaphor appears without violence, if it is <i>familiarly</i>
expressed; and we the more easily catch the warmest feeling, if
we perceive that it is intentionally lowered in expression, out of condescension
to our calmer temper. It is thus that harangues and declamations,
the last proof of bad taste and bad manners in conversation,
are avoided, while the fancy and the heart find the means of pouring
forth all their stores. To meet this despised part of language in a
polished dress, and producing all the effects of wit and eloquence, is a
constant source of agreeable surprise. This is increased, when a few
bolder and higher words are happily wrought into the texture of this
familiar eloquence. To find what seems so unlike author-craft in a
book raises the pleasing astonishment to its highest degree. I once
thought of illustrating my notions by numerous examples from “La
Sevigné.” And I must, some day or other, do so; though I think it
the resource of a bungler who is not enough master of language to convey
his conceptions into the minds of others. The style of Madame de
Sevigné is evidently copied, not only by her worshiper, Walpole, but
even by Gray; who, notwithstanding the extraordinary merits of his
matter, has the double stiffness of an imitator and of a college recluse.</p>

<hr class='c049' />
<h3 class='c012'>PRIDE AND MEANNESS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Rousseau has well described this association of Pride
and Stinginess, which is very common: “We take from nature,
from real pleasures, nay, from the stock of necessaries,
what we lavish upon opinion. One man adorns his palace
at the expense of his kitchen; another prefers a fine service
of plate to a good dinner; a third makes a sumptuous entertainment,
and starves himself the rest of the year. When
I see a sideboard richly decorated, I expect the wine to be
very indifferent. How often in the country, when we breathe
the fresh morning air, are we not tempted by the prospect
of a fine garden! We rise early, and by walking gain a keen
appetite, which makes us wish for breakfast. Perhaps the
domestic is out of the way, or provisions are wanting, or the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>lady has not given her orders, and you are tired to death
with waiting. Sometimes people prevent your desires, or
make you a very pompous offer of every thing, upon condition
that you accept of nothing. You must fast till three
o’clock, or breakfast with the tulips. I remember to have
walked in a very beautiful park, which belonged to a lady
who, though extremely fond of coffee, never drank any but
when at a very low price; yet she liberally allowed her gardener
a salary of a thousand crowns. For my part, I should
choose to have tulips less finely variegated, and to drink
coffee whenever my appetite called for it.”</p>

<hr class='c027' />
<h3 class='c012'>HOME THOUGHTS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>There is much to be learned from domestic annals.
Southey has well observed: “The history of any private
family, however humble, could it be fairly related for five or
six generations, would illustrate the state and progress of
society better than could be done by the most elaborate
historian.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Cheerfulness and a festival spirit fills the soul full of
harmony; it composes music for churches and hearts; it
makes and publishes glorifications of God; it produces thankfulness,
and serves the ends of charity; and when the oil of
gladness runs over, it makes bright and tall emissions of holy
fires, reaching up to a cloud, and making joy round about:
and therefore, since it is so innocent, and may be so pious,
and full of holy advantage, whatever can minister to this
holy joy does set forward the work of religion and charity.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c025'><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>In how delightful a strain has the same writer said:
“There is some virtue or other to be exercised, whatever
happens, either patience or thanksgiving, love or fear, moderation
or humility, charity or contentedness; and they are,
every one of them, equally in order to his great end and immortal
felicity: and beauty is not made by white or red, by
black eyes and a round face, by a straight body and a smooth
skin, but by a proportion to the fancy. Whatever we talk,
things are as they are; not as we grant, dispute, or hope,
depending on neither our affirmative nor negative; but
upon the rate and value which God sets upon things.”</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Lord Macaulay, too, has left us this touching picture:</p>

<p class='c028'>Children, look in those eyes, listen to that dear voice, notice the
feeling of even a single touch that is bestowed upon you by that gentle
hand! Make much of it while yet you have that most precious of all
good gifts—a loving mother. Read the unfathomable love of those
eyes; the kind anxiety of that tone and look, however slight your pain.
In after-life you may have friends—fond, dear, kind friends—but never
will you have again the inexpressible love and gentleness lavished upon
you which none but a mother bestows. Often do I sigh in my struggles
with the hard, uncaring world, for the sweet, deep security I felt when,
of an evening, nestling to her bosom, I listened to some quiet tale,
suitable to my age, read in her tender and untiring voice. Never can
I forget her sweet glances cast upon me when I appeared asleep; never
her kiss of peace at night. Years have passed away since we laid
her beside my father in the old churchyard; yet still her voice whispers
from the grave, and her eye watches over me as I visit spots long since
hallowed to the memory of my mother.</p>

<p class='c023'>We pass from these traits of sweet simplicity to a lesson
for riper age, by a living writer of sterling humour:</p>

<p class='c028'>It is better for you to pass an evening once or twice a week in a
lady’s drawing-room, even though the conversation is slow, and you know
the girl’s song by heart, than in a club, tavern, or the pit of a theatre.
All amusements of youth to which virtuous women are not admitted,
rely on it, are deleterious to their nature. All men who avoid female
society have dull perceptions and are stupid, or have gross tastes and
revolt against what is pure. Your club-swaggerers, who are sucking
the butts of billiard-cues all night, call female society insipid. Poetry
is uninspiring to a yokel; beauty has no charms for a blind man; music
does not please a poor beast who does not know one tune from another;
but as a true epicure is hardly ever tired of water, sancey, and brown
bread and butter, I protest I can sit for a whole night talking to a well-regulated,
kindly woman about her girl Fanny or her boy Frank, and
like the evening’s entertainment. One of the great benefits a man
may derive from woman’s society is, that he is bound to be respectful
to her. The habit is of great good to your moral men, depend upon
it. Our education makes of use the most eminently selfish men in the
world. We fight for ourselves, we push for ourselves, we yawn for ourselves,
we light our pipes and say we won’t go out, we prefer ourselves
and our ease; and the greatest that comes to a man from a woman’s
society is, that he has to think of somebody to whom he is bound to be
constantly attentive and respectful.—<i>Thackeray.</i></p>

<p class='c023'>Every virtue enjoined by Christianity as a virtue, is recommended
by politeness as an accomplishment. Gentleness,
humility, deference, affability, and a readiness to assist
and serve on all occasions, are as necessary in the composition
of a true Christian as in that of a well-bred man.
Passion, moroseness, peevishness, and supercilious self-sufficiency,
are equally repugnant to the characters of both,
who differ in this only, that the true Christian really is what
the well-bred man pretends to be, and would still be better
bred if he was.—<i>Soame Jenyns.</i></p>

  <h2 class='c006'>The Spirit of the Age.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c047' />
<h3 class='c012'>PROGRESS OF KNOWLEDGE.</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>The</span> zeal which Albert, Prince Consort, evinced in furthering
good works,—his sympathy with the wants of the poor,
their bodily health and comfort, and their intellectual and
moral culture,—will long endear his memory to the grateful
people of the country of his adoption.</p>

<p class='c021'>It was a characteristic of his genius that he would never
consent to take the lead in any movement until he had, as
far as possible, satisfied himself of its proper object and
practicability. That he fully understood and appreciated
the requirements of the age, is evident from the following
passage in one of his manly Addresses:</p>

<p class='c021'>“Whilst formerly the greatest mental energies strove at
universal knowledge, and that knowledge was confined to
the few, now they are directed on specialities, and in these
again even to the minutest points; but the knowledge acquired
becomes at once the property of the community at
large; for, whilst formerly discovery was wrapped in secrecy,
the publicity of the present day causes, that no
sooner is a discovery or invention made, than it is already
improved upon and surpassed by competing efforts. The
products of all quarters of the globe are placed at our disposal,
and we have only to choose which is the best and
the cheapest for our purposes, and the powers of production
are intrusted to the stimulus of competition and capital.
So man is approaching a more complete fulfilment
of that great and sacred mission which he has to perform in
this world. His reason being created after the image of
God, he has to use it to discover the laws by which the
Almighty governs His creation, and, by making these laws
his standard of action, to conquer nature to his use; himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>a Divine instrument. Science discovers these laws of
power, motion, and transformation; industry applies them
to the raw matter, which the earth yields us in abundance,
but which become valuable only by knowledge. Art teaches
us the immutable laws of beauty and symmetry, and gives
to our productions forms in accordance to them.” Again:
“To the human mind nothing is so fascinating as progress.
It is not what we have long had that we most prize.
We highly prize new accessions; but we enjoy almost unconsciously
gifts, of far more value, we have long been in
possession of. This is our nature; thus we are constituted.
It is not surprising, therefore, that we should have a peculiar
relish for new discoveries. The interest of discovery,
however, is not permanent. For a time we are dazzled by
its brilliancy; but gradually the impression fades away, and
at last is lost entirely in the splendour of some fresh discovery
which carries with it the charm of novelty. When
we reflect upon this, we cannot help perceiving in how very
different a state the world would be from what it is if mankind
in the beginning had been in the possession of all the
knowledge we now have, and there had been no progress
ever since.”</p>

<p class='c021'>There is no royal death within memory of the present
generation which has caused such grave and regretful reflection
as the sudden manner in which the Prince Consort
was taken from our beloved Sovereign and her family, at
the close of the year 1861. The nearest approach to the
public sorrow upon this melancholy occasion was the universal
sympathy expressed on the loss of the Princess Charlotte,
in 1817, when the mother and offspring were at once
swept by the hand of death into the same grave! Put
widespread as was the lamentation of the people for their
hopes being thus crushed, it differed in this respect from the
sorrow for the Prince Consort,—that in the one case expectation
was blighted, but in the other realisation was extinguished
when the fruits of superior intelligence were fast
ripening into the maturity of true greatness.</p>

<p class='c021'>Since the death of the Prince the country has learned
the full extent of its loss by this sad event. Yet it was
plainly asserted in the <i>Leader</i> newspaper, ten years ago,
that the Prince was “becoming the most popular man in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>England;” and the reader was assured that the above paper
was written to put the Prince’s “position and his services
in the point of view in which we may comprehend him, and
be grateful to him.” This statement was unheeded at the
time it was made; but, in the year following, other journalists
had discovered that the Prince had some voice in
English foreign policy,—a charge which was admitted to be
true by Ministers in Parliament. Public attention was then
turned in an entirely different direction, and the Prince
resumed his powerful popular position. Yet his weighty
influence, as we have said, was not fully made known until
recently. We have seen but one acknowledgment of the service
of the well-informed and far-seeing writer in the <i>Leader</i>,
and to this was not attached his name. We therefore add, in
justice to the memory of a man of rare talent, and the right
spirit of independence, which is the best characteristic of a
public journalist, that the writer in question was the late
Mr. E. M. Whitty, who reprinted the above in <i>The Governing
Classes of Great Britain</i>.</p>

<hr class='c027' />
<h3 class='c012'>SPECIAL PROVIDENCE IN SCIENCE.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The records of science furnish us with examples in which
complicated causes have operated through vast periods of
duration anterior to man’s existence, or even anterior to that
of the existence of any of the more perfect animals, in order
to provide for the wants and happiness of those animals,
especially of man. Laws, apparently conflicting and irregular
in their action, have been so controlled and directed,
and made to conspire, as to provide for the wants of civilised
life untold ages before man’s existence. In those early
times, vast forests, for instance, might have been growing
along the shores of estuaries; and these dying, were buried
deep in the mud, there to accumulate thick beds of vegetable
matter over huge areas; and this, by a long series of changes,
was at length converted into coal. This could be of no use
whatever till man’s existence, nor even then, till civilisation
had taught him to employ the substance for his comfort,
and for a great variety of useful arts.</p>

<p class='c021'>Dr. Hitchcock illustrates this position as follows: Look,
for instance, at the small island of Great Britain. At this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>day 15,000 steam-engines are driven by means of coal, with
a power equal to that of 2,000,000 of men; and thus is put
into operation machinery equalling the unaided power of
300,000,000 or 400,000,000 of men. The influence thence
emanating reaches the remotest portions of the globe, and
tends mightily to the civilisation and happiness of the
race. And is all this an accidental effect of nature’s laws?
Is it not rather a striking example of special protective providence?
What else but divine power, intent upon a specific
purpose, could have so directed the countless agencies
employed through so many ages as to bring about such
marvellous results?<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c025'><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<hr class='c027' />
<h3 class='c012'>SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>School-learning is, undoubtedly, the best foundation:
“In all industrial pursuits connected with the natural
sciences, in fact in all pursuits not simply dependent on
manual dexterity, the development of the intellectual faculties,
by what may be termed ’school-learning,’ constitutes
the basis and chief condition of progress and of every improvement.
A young man with a mind well stored with
solid scientific acquirements will, without difficulty or
effort, master the technical part of an industrial pursuit;
whereas, in general, an individual who may be thoroughly
master of the technical part is altogether incapable of seizing
upon any new fact that has not previously presented
itself to him, or of comprehending a scientific principle and
its application.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Lord Stanhope has thus strikingly illustrated the subject:</p>

<p class='c028'>See how the field of human knowledge is extended. Within the last
fifty years there is scarce a branch of knowledge, even in those which
have been explored for hundreds of years—classical learning, for example—which
has not received some new and important additions.
But not only this; it may be said that new sciences have been discovered.
Who, seventy or eighty years ago, thought or heard of the
name of geology, or of men like Cuvier, who by their genius have
brought back to us the forms of long-extinct animals, and the state of
the earth as it must have existed thousands of years ago? Who could
have imagined that in art such vast resources should have been opened up
to us, as, for instance, the now-familiar science of photography supplies?
Who would have imagined that railways, which have enabled us at so
quick a rate to have communication with all parts of the country, would
become a study of well-regulated curiosity; or that the instantaneous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>power of transmission which we possess in the electric telegraph should
be imparted to the whole of the people who now crowd these busy
shores?</p>

<p class='c023'>Some of the noblest triumphs of science, however, do
but show the shortsightedness of man, and seem to dictate
to him that great results can only be obtained by gradual
and patient labour, as if to keep in check his overweening
conceit. This is illustrated in the discovery of Voltaism.
“When Galvani,” says Lord Brougham, in his powerful
manner, “observed the contortions of the muscle in a dead
frog, or even when Volta gave an explanation of them, how
little could it be foreseen that the discovery would lead not
only to the decomposition of bodies which had resisted all
attempts to ascertain their constituent parts, and bring us
acquainted with substances wholly unlike any before known,
as metals that floated in water and took fire on exposure to
the air; but, after having thus changed the face of chemical
science, should also impress a new character upon the
moral, judicial, and political world! Yet this has undeniably
been the result of the discovery made by Volta.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The histories of invention present many instances of
“the slip between the cup and the lip.” New modes of
lighting have been very productive of such disappointments.
About thirty years since was patented a light by the admixture
of the vapour of hydrocarbons with atmospheric air, so
as to produce an illumination equal in brilliancy to that of
the purest gas; the power of light from a ten-hole burner
equalling that of 22-1/8th wax-candles. This invention had been
a long and costly labour; a single set of experiments having
cost 500<i>l.</i> At length the patent was sold to a company for the
large sum of 28,000<i>l.</i>; a plant was established, licenses were
advertised for sale, and, among the confident promises, it
was held out that the gas-pipes and mains of the existing
companies might be bought up for the requirements of this
new light! But the working of the invention did not succeed
in detail (indeed, it had been purchased with the knowledge
that it was incomplete); and the entire capital invested,
some 40,000<i>l.</i> or 50,000<i>l.</i>, was lost!</p>

<hr class='c027' />
<h3 class='c012'>TIME AND IMPROVEMENT.</h3>

<p class='c023'>The Rev. Dr. Temple, in his glowing Essay, “Education
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>of the World,” thus maintains that all human improvement
is the result of the accumulations of Time:</p>

<p class='c028'>To the spirit all things that exist must have a purpose, and nothing
can pass away till that purpose be fulfilled. The lapse of time is no
exception to this demand. Each moment of time, as it passes, is taken
up in the shape of permanent results into the time that follows, and
only perishes by being converted into something more substantial than
itself. Thus, each successive age incorporates into itself the substance
of the preceding,—the power whereby the present ever gathers itself
into the past, transforms the human race into a colossal man, whose life
reaches from the Creation to the Day of Judgment. The successive
generations of men are days in this man’s life. The discoveries and
inventions which characterise the different epochs of the world’s history
are his works. The creeds and doctrines, the opinions and principles
of the successive ages, are his thoughts. The states of society at different
times are his manners. He grows in knowledge, in self-control, in
visible size, just as we do. And his education is in the same way, and
for the same reason, precisely similar to ours. All this is no figure, but
only a compendious statement of a very comprehensive fact.</p>

<hr class='c049' />
<h3 class='c012'>EVIL INFLUENCES.</h3>

<p class='c023'>It has been asked by a great author, “What does it signify
whether you deny a God or speak ill of Him?”—a
question well answered by another sage, when he declares,
“I would rather men should say that there never was such
a man as Plutarch, than that Plutarch was an ill-natured,
mischievous fellow.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Nearly eighty years ago Mr. Sharp wrote, “There can
be no reasonable doubt that it is better to believe too much
than too little; since, as Boswell observes (most probably in
Johnson’s words), ‘A man may breathe in foul air, but he
must die in an exhausted receiver.’”</p>

<p class='c021'>Much of the scepticism that we meet with is necessarily
affectation or conceit; for it is as likely that the ignorant,
weak, and indolent should become mathematicians as reasoning
unbelievers. Patient study and perfect impartiality
must precede rational conviction, whether ending in faith
or doubt. Need it be asked, how many are capable of such
an examination? But whether they come honestly by their
opinions or not, it is much more advisable to refute than to
burn, or even to scorch them.</p>

<p class='c021'>It has been shrewdly remarked by a contemporary:</p>

<p class='c028'>All the voices which have any real influence with an Englishman in
easy circumstances combine to stimulate a low form of energy, which
stifles every high one. The newspapers extol his wisdom by assuming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>that the average intelligence which he represents is, under the name of
public opinion, the ultimate and irresponsible ruler of the nation. The
novels which he and his family devour with insatiable greediness have
no tendency to rouse his imagination, to say nothing of his mind. They
are pictures of the every-day life to which he has always been accustomed,—sarcastic,
sentimental, or ludicrous, as the case may be,—but
never rising to any thing which could ever suggest the existence of
tragic dignity or ideal beauty. The human mind has made considerable
advances in the last three-and-twenty centuries; but the thousands
of Greeks who could enjoy not only Euripides, but Homer and
Æschylus, were superior, in some important points, to the millions of
Englishmen who in their inmost hearts prefer Pickwick to Shakspeare.
Even the religion of the present day is made to suit the level of commonplace
Englishmen. There was a time when Christianity meant the
embodiment of all truth and holiness in the midst of a world lying in
wickedness. It afterwards included law, liberty, and knowledge, as
opposed to the energetic ignorance of the northern barbarians. It now
too often means philanthropic societies—excellent things as far as they
go, but rather small. Any doctrine now is given up if it either seems
uncomfortable or likely to make a disturbance. It is almost universally
assumed that the truth of an opinion is tested by its consistency with
cheerful views of life and nature. Unpleasant doctrines are only
preached under incredible forms, and thus serve to spice the enjoyments
which they would otherwise destroy.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c025'><sup>[122]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>WORLDLY MORALITY.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Professor Blackie, in his eloquent Edinburgh Essay, has
these stringent remarks upon the lax morality of the day:</p>

<p class='c028'>There is in the world always a respectable sort of surface morality,—and
nowhere more than in this British world at the present hour,—a
morality of convenience and utility, which pays respect to the principles
of right and wrong when generally formalised, but which recognises
them practically only in so far as local customs and decencies,
proprieties, etiquettes, and the round of certain “inevitable charities,”
are willing to recognise them. This morality many a consumer of beefsteaks
and swiller of porter in this lusty and material land accepts,
after eighteen hundred years of Gospel preaching, as quite sufficient for
all the purposes of a respectable English life. But the perverse maxims
and vicious practices with which our British society is rank, make
it evident to the most superficial glance how far the current morality
of our trades and parties is from seeking to accommodate itself to the
principles of extreme moral purity laid down in every page of the New
Testament. A sermon may be a very proper thing as Sunday work,
and may help to bridge the way to heaven, when a bridge shall be
required; but on Monday a man must attend to his business, and act
according to the maxims of his trade, of his party, of his corporation,
of his vestry. Then the respectable sporting-man will stake his last
thousand on the leg of a race-horse, and think it quite like a Christian
gentleman to allow his tailor’s bill to be unpaid for another year; then
the respectable Highland proprietor will refuse to renew the lease to
the industrious poor cotter on his estate, that the people, for whom he
cares nothing, may make way for the red-deer, which it is his only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>passion to stalk; then the respectable brewer, instead of preparing
wholesome drink from wholesome grain, will infect his brewst with deleterious
drugs in order to excite a factitious thirst in the stomach of his
customers, and increase the amount of drinking; then a respectable
corporation, to maintain their own “vested rights,” will move heaven
and earth to prevent the national parliament from acting on the plainest
rules of justice and common sense in a matter seriously affecting
the public well-being; and the respectable members of society shall
flutter round the gilded wax-lights of aristocracy, and perform worship
at Hudson’s statue, and have respect to men with gold rings and
goodly apparel, and do every thing that is expressly forbidden in the
second chapter of the Epistle of James, which they profess to receive
as a divine rule of conduct. These are only one or two of the more
glaring points in which our commonly-received maxims and practice
of respectable British life run directly in the face of that highest morality,
which the most religious and church-going Englishman professes
to acknowledge as his rule of conduct.</p>

<p class='c023'>Professor Blackie concludes with the gospel text, “What
shall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world and lose his
own soul?” which the Professor applies in the plain practical
question: “What will it profit England to spin more
cotton, to pile more money-bags, to set more steam-coaches
a-going, if Mammon is to be worshiped every where, rather
than virtue and wisdom?” &amp;c.</p>

<hr class='c027' />
<h3 class='c012'>SPEAKING THE TRUTH.</h3>

<p class='c023'>One of the sublimest things in the world is plain Truth.
Indeed it is so sublime as to be entirely out of the reach
of many people.</p>

<p class='c021'>The ancients said many fine things of Truth; but nothing
to exceed in practical worth the love of Truth shown
by the great Duke of Wellington in every phase of his wonderful
career, of which the majority of us have been, more
or less, contemporary witnesses.</p>

<p class='c021'>“The foundation of all justice,” said this truly great
man, “is Truth; and the mode of discovering truth has
always been to administer an oath, in order that the witness
may give his depositions under a high sanction.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Elsewhere he said, when advocating the cause of the
Church of England, “I am resolved to tell plainly and
honestly what I think, quite regardless of the odium I may
incur from those whose prejudices my candour and sincerity
may offend. I am here to speak the truth, and not to flatter
the prejudices of any man. In speaking the truth, I shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>utter it in the language that truth itself most naturally
suggests. It is upon her native strength—upon her own
truth—it is upon her spiritual character, and upon the purity
of her doctrines, that the Church of England rests.”</p>

<p class='c021'>When, upon the death of Sir Robert Peel, the Duke of
Wellington sought to express what seemed to him most admirable
in the character of his friend, he said that he was
<i>the truest man he had ever known;</i> adding: “I was long connected
with him in public life. We were both in the councils
of our sovereign together, and I had long the honour to
enjoy his private friendship. In all the course of my acquaintance
with Sir Robert Peel, I never knew a man in
whose truth and justice I had a more lively confidence, or
in whom I saw a more invariable desire to promote the
public service. In the whole course of my communication
with him I never knew an instance in which he did not
show the strongest attachment to truth; and I never saw,
in the whole course of my life, the smallest reason for suspecting
that he stated any thing which he did not firmly
believe to be the fact.”</p>

<p class='c021'>It was the instinct of a man, himself as true as he was
great, thus to place the regard for truth in the front rank of
human qualities. On that simple and noble basis his own
nature rested. Wellington could not vapour, or even utter
a lie in a bulletin. Every thing with him was simple,
direct, straightforward, and went to the heart of its purpose,
if any thing could. In all that has singled out England
from the nations, and given her the front place in the
history of the world, the Duke of Wellington was emphatically
an Englishman. His patience, his probity, his punctuality
in the smallest things, in every thing the practical
fidelity and reliability of his character, we rejoice to regard
as the type of that which has made us the great people that
we are. It has indeed been well said that the Duke’s whole
existence was a practical refutation of all falsehood.</p>

<hr class='c027' />
<h3 class='c012'>RESTLESSNESS AND ENTERPRISE.</h3>

<p class='c023'>An anxious, restless temper, that runs to meet care on
its way, that regrets lost opportunities too much, and that
is over-painstaking in contrivances for happiness, is foolish,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>and should not be indulged.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c025'><sup>[123]</sup></a> If you cannot be happy in
one way, be happy in another; and this facility of disposition
wants but little aid from philosophy, for health and
good-humour are almost the whole affair. Many run about
after felicity, like an absent man hunting for his hat while
it is on his head or in his hand. Though sometimes small
evils, like invisible insects, inflict great pain, yet the chief
secret of comfort lies in not suffering trifles to vex one, and
in prudently cultivating an undergrowth of small pleasures,
since very few great ones, alas, are let on long leases.</p>

<p class='c021'>Nothing will justify, or even excuse, dejection. Untoward
accidents will sometimes happen; but, after many
years’ experience (writes Mr. Sharp), I can truly say, that
nearly all those who began life with me have succeeded, or
failed, as they deserved:</p>

<p class='c021'>Though you may look to your understanding for amusement,
it is to the affections that we must trust for happiness,
These imply a spirit of self-sacrifice; and often our virtues,
like our children, are endeared to us by what we suffer for
them. Conscience, even when it fails to govern our conduct,
can disturb our peace of mind. Yes, it is neither paradoxical
nor merely poetical to say:</p>

<p class='c021'>This solid yet romantic maxim is found in no less a writer
than Plato; who, it has been well observed, sometimes in
his moral lessons, as well as in his theological, is almost,
though not altogether, a Christian.</p>

<p class='c021'>The passion for enterprise and adventure is the shoal
upon which high hopes are constantly being wrecked. We
remember, some thirty years since, a merchant of London,
who inherited a princely fortune, which he embarked in
speculations of almost astounding magnitude. He was a
large-minded and generous man; and among other instances
of his liberality, was his aid to scientific explorations, in acknowledgment
of which he received an honorary Fellowship
of the Royal Society. He published upon political economy
and monetary questions; and with that fatality which often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>attends those who aspire to public business, our merchant,
in some measure, out-ventured his own. Before the problematical
economy of vast steam-ships had been settled,
he invested large sums in this class of speculation. He was
rather athirst for fresh fields than for the gold itself; and
with this view he and his family ceded to a chartered company
a group of islands discovered some forty years previously
through their enterprise, and which the Government
had granted them in consideration for their services in
more recent discoveries of the southern continent. It was
then resolved to colonise the islands as the head-station of
the southern whale-fishery; our merchant receiving the appointment
of lieutenant-governor. Troops of friends and
well-wishers attended the leave-taking; the voyage out was
fair and auspicious, and the governor and his little staff
planted their bare emblem of authority upon the islands.</p>

<p class='c021'>The scheme was reasonable; for whale-fishing was rife in
the neighbouring seas, and sperm-whales even came into
the anchorage. The country is luxuriantly wooded, the flowering
plants abound; and the climate is mild, temperate,
and salubrious. But the fishery failed, and the horizon
soon grew dark with gathering clouds of discontent among
the colonists; and there arose cabals, the usual consequence
of defeated hopes: as success brightly colours all things in
life, so failures darken them. After many months of suffering
from indignities heaped upon him by exasperated adventurers,
and the confusion which follows such mischances,
the governor’s brief authority was respected only by <i>two</i> individuals
among the six-score colonists. Such heartless desertion
in a land upon whose storm-beaten shores human
foot had rarely set, would have made many a stout heart
quail: not so our almost friendless representative of authority;
and at length the many closed their cruel indignities
by determining that he should leave the islands by the first
ship which should touch there. This stern resolve was
carried into effect; and our merchant-prince, solitary in all
respects save hope, returned to the home which he had left
amid a choir of aspirations. He memorialised the Government
for redress, and besought parliament-men to assert
his wrongs; but the only result was the usual official coldness
and disinclination to interfere in troublesome matters;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>although the enterprise was, at the commencement, fully
recognised by the colonial authorities at home.</p>

<p class='c021'>This is a painful story of a few years’ misadventure and
wrecked fortune, and ingratitude to a man whose honour
and integrity, in the face of misfortune, should at least have
shielded him from insult. Yet how forcibly does it illustrate
the perils which so often beset the restless spirit!</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE PRESENT AND THE PAST.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Sharon Turner, a man of sound, practical sense, as well
as a reverential and reflective writer of history, has these
pertinent remarks upon the tendency of historians to magnify
the Present at the expense of the Past:</p>

<p class='c028'>Nothing is a greater reproach, to the reasoning intellect of any age
than a splenetic censoriousness on the manners and characters of our
ancestors. It is but common justice for us to bear in mind that in
those times we should have been as they were, as they in ours would
have resembled ourselves. Both are but the same men, acting under
different circumstances, wearing different dresses, and pursuing different
objects; but neither inferior to the other in talent, industry, or
intellectual worth. The more we study biography, we shall perceive
more evidence of this truth.</p>

<p class='c041'>Disregarding what satire might, without being cynical, lash in our
own costumes, we are apt to look proudly back on those who have gone
before us, and to regale our self-complacency with comparisons of their
deficiencies, and of our greater merit. The retrospect is pleasing, but
it offers no ground for exultation. We are superior, and we have in
many things better taste and sounder judgment and wiser habits than
they possessed. And why? Because we have had means of superiority
by which they were not assisted. But a merit which owes its origin
merely to our having followed, instead of preceding, in existence, gives
us no right to depreciate those over whom our only advantage has been
the better fortune of a later chronology. We may therefore allow those
who have gone before us to have been amused with what would weary
or dissatisfy us, without either sarcasms on their absurdities, or contemptuous
wonder at their stately childishness and pompous inanities.</p>

<p class='c023'>One of our most popular historians indulges to excess in
these brilliant antitheses, which in his pages remind one of
poppies in corn.</p>

<hr class='c027' />
<h3 class='c012'>CIRCUMSTANCES AND GENIUS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>This episode in man’s history,—this stage in the great
struggle of life,—has been thus powerfully painted by a contemporary:</p>

<p class='c028'>We presume there can be little doubt that circumstances have an
effect upon the lives and characters of men; to say any thing else would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>be to contradict flatly the ordinary opinion of the world. Notwithstanding,
if one will but look at one’s private experience among the
most ordinary and obscure actors in the life-drama, how wonderfully,
one must allow, character, temper, heart, and spirit, assert themselves
beyond the reach of all external powers! How triumphantly the poor
prodigal, to whom Providence has given the fairest prospects, and
whose steps are guarded by love and kindness, can vindicate his own
instincts against all the virtuous force of circumstance surrounding
him, and go to destruction in its very face! Who needs to be taught
that ever-recurring lesson? Who can be ignorant that scarcely a great
career has ever been made in this world otherwise than in the face of
circumstances—in strenuous defiance of all that external elements could
do to overcome the unconquerable soul? In the face of such examples,
what are we to say to the theory that adverse circumstances can excuse
a man born with all the compensations of genius for an unlovely
and ignoble life, a bitter and discontented heart, a course of vulgar
vice and sordid meanness? Never was genius more wickedly disparaged.
That celestial gift to which God has given capacities of enjoyment
beyond the reach of the crowd, is of itself an armour against
circumstance more proof than steel, and continually holds open to its
possessor a refuge against the affronts of the world, a shelter from its
contumelies, which is denied to other men. He who reckons of this
endowment as of something which gives only a more exquisite egotism,
a finer touch of selfishness, a sublimation of envy and self-assertion,
and dependence upon the applause of the crowd, forms a mean
estimate, against which it is the duty of every man who knows better to
protest. Outside circumstances, disappointment, neglect, dark want
and misery, have plagued the souls and disturbed the temper of great
men before now, but have never, so far as we are aware, polluted a pure
heart, or made a noble mind despicable. The bitter soreness of unappreciated
genius belongs proverbially to those whose gift is of the
smallest; and the man who excuses a bad life by the pretence that this
divine lymph contained within it has been soured by popular neglect
and turned to gall, speaks sacrilege and profanity.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c025'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>OUR UNIMAGINATIVE AGE.</h3>

<p class='c023'>We have now no great poets; and our poverty in this
respect is not compensated by the fact, that we once had
them, and that we may, and do, read their works. The
movement has gone by; the charm is broken; the bond of
union, though not cancelled, is seriously weakened. Hence
our age, great as it is, and in nearly all respects greater
than any the world has yet seen, has, notwithstanding its
large and generous sentiments, its unexampled toleration,
its love of liberty, and its profuse and almost reckless charity,
a certain material, unimaginative, and unheroic character,
which has made several observers tremble for the
future.... That something has been lost is unquestionable.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>We have lost much of that imagination which, though
in practical life it often misleads, is, in speculative life, one
of the highest of all qualities, being suggestive as well as
creative. Even practically we should cherish it, because
the commerce of the affections mainly depends on it. It is,
however, declining; while, at the same time, the increasing
refinement of society accustoms us more and more to suppress
our emotions, lest they be disagreeable to others.
And as the play of the emotions is the chief study of the
poet, we see in this circumstance another reason which
makes it difficult to rival that great body of poetry which
our ancestors possessed. We quote the above from the
second volume of Mr. Buckle’s <i>History of Civilization</i>. We
would add, that the suppression of emotions to which the
author refers is one great cause of the difficulty of getting
persons to speak the truth in the present day: they are ever
disguising their feelings, until hypocritical caution becomes
habit, and it requires a stronger light than the old cynic
possessed to find honest men. The low standard of commercial
morality, and the time-serving expediency which so
greatly regulates the actions of our rulers and those who
make the laws, is traceable to this over-refinement.</p>

<hr class='c027' />
<h3 class='c012'>MARVELS OF THE UNIVERSE.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Nothing is more startling, or more likely to be received
with incredulity by minds unprepared for their reception,
than what are, in common parlance, termed the Marvels of
the Universe. The philosophical writers of our day have
strikingly illustrated this fact, which should be taken into
account in writing of the <i>impedimenta</i> to the progress of
science even in our own day. Sir John Herschel has thus
forcibly stated the case:</p>

<p class='c028'>What mere assertion will make any one believe that in one second
of time, in one beat of the pendulum of a clock, a ray of light travels
over 192,000 miles, and would therefore perform the tour of the world
in about the same time that it requires to wink with our eyelids, and in
much less than a swift runner occupies in taking a single stride? What
mortal can be made to believe, without demonstration, that the sun is
almost a million times larger than the earth? and that, although so
remote from us that a cannon-ball shot directly towards it, and maintaining
its full speed, would be twenty years in reaching it, yet it
affects the earth by its attraction in an appreciable instant of time?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Who would not ask for demonstration, when told that a gnat’s wing,
in its ordinary flight, beats many hundred times in a second; or that
there exists animated and regularly-organised beings, many thousands
of whose bodies laid close together would not extend an inch? But
what are these to the astonishing truths which modern optical inquiries
have disclosed, which teach us that every point of a medium through
which a ray of light passes, is affected with a succession of periodical
movements, regularly recurring at equal intervals, no less than five
hundred millions of millions of times in a single second! That it is by
such movements communicated to the nerves of our eyes that we see;
nay, more, that it is the difference in the frequency of their recurrence
which affects us with the sense of the diversity of colour. That, for
instance, in acquiring the sensation of redness, our eyes are affected
four hundred and eighty-two millions of millions of times; of yellowness,
five hundred and forty-two millions of millions of times; and of
violet, seven hundred and seven millions of millions of times per
second. Do not such things sound more like the ravings of madmen
than the sober conclusions of people in their waking senses? They are,
nevertheless, conclusions to which any one may most certainly arrive
who will only be at the trouble of examining the chain of reasoning by
which they have been obtained.</p>

<p class='c023'>Professor Airy, however, considers this difficulty to be
over-estimated. He observes, that “persons who take great
interest in Astronomy appear to regard the determination of
measures, like those of the distance of the sun and moon, as
mysteries beyond ordinary comprehension, based perhaps
upon principles which it is impossible to present to common
minds with the smallest probability that they will be understood;
if they accept these measures at all, they adopt them
only upon loose personal credit; in any case, the impression
which the statement makes on the mind is very different
from that created by a record of the distance in miles between
two towns, or the number of acres in a field.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Now, the measure of the moon’s distance involves no
principle more abstruse than the measure of the distance of
a tree on the opposite bank of a river; and the Professor
shows that the methods used for measuring astronomical
distances are, in some applications, absolutely the same as
the methods of ordinary theodolite surveying, and are in
other applications equivalent to them; and that, in fact,
there is nothing in their principles which will present the
smallest difficulty to a person who has attempted the common
practice of plotting from angular measures.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c025'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>The habit of beholding the spectacle of the sun gradually
sinking, to disappear after a time below the level of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>the sea,—this habit, we say, and our astronomical knowledge,
have long since familiarised us with the phenomenon
which, undoubtedly, would appear inexplicable were
we to witness it for the first time, and without being prepared.
Who has not in childhood felt this wonder? The
ancients were far from being able to account for it: some
Greek philosophers regarded the sun as an inflamed mass,
which plunged itself every night into the waters of the sea;
and they pretended to have heard a hissing noise! We
have found the same idea lingering among the credulous
peasantry of Sussex. We remember our first nurse, a native
of Battle, used to relate that, from the cliffs at Eastbourne,
she had seen the comet of 1769 dip its tail into the sea,
and that she had distinctly heard the “hissing noise.” Such
is the persistence of certain impressions, which, monstrous
as they are, can only be explained away by reasoning.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c025'><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>PHYSIOGNOMY.</h3>

<p class='c023'>Sir David Brewster, in his introductory Address to the
University of Edinburgh, 1862-3, remarked that one of the
characteristics of the age in which we live was its love of
the mysterious and marvellous.</p>

<p class='c028'>I refer (said Sir David) to the so-called science of physiognomy, but
more especially to that morbid expansion of it called the physiognomy
of the human form, which has been elaborated in Germany, and is now
likely to obtain possession of the English mind. In want of any other
arguments, our physiognomists assert that it is simply probable that
the outer form would be designed on purpose to represent the mental
character, and on this ground they dogmatically declare that the expressions
of rage, or grief, or fear have been “divinely designed on
purpose that the inner mind may be known to those who watch the
outer man.” The persons who use such arguments and have recourse
to such assumptions never propose to make any inductive comparison
of a certain number of well-measured forms with the well-ascertained
mental phases with which they are associated. Were such experiments
made, they would yield no result. No two physiognomists, acting separately,
would agree in measuring and characterising the forms and
indications of the head, the features, the hands, and the feet of the
patient; and no two men—neither the sagacious judge on the bench,
nor the shrewd counsel at the bar—could determine his real character
were they to conjure with all the events of his life. In this new physiognomy,
a head large in the mid region indicates a predominance of
the feelings over the other faculties; a proneness to superstition and
fanaticism is shown by a little increase in the elevation; and a head
large behind evinces practical ability; and, as Dr. Carus says, characterises
a race which will give birth to great historic names! Small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>heads, however, are not to be despised. They indicate talent, but not
genius; while very small ones belong, he says, to the excitable class,
from whom “a great part of the misery of society arises.” In the
varying expressions of the human face physiognomists find a better
support for their views. That the emotions of the past and the present
leave permanent traces on the human countenance is doubtless true,
and to this extent we are all physiognomists, often very presumptuous
ones, and, excepting accidental coincidences, always in the wrong,
when we infer from any external appearance the character and disposition
of our neighbour. In every class of society we encounter faces
which we instinctively shun, and others to which we as instinctively
cling. But how frequently have we found our estimates to be false!
The repulsive aspect has proved to be the result of physical suffering,
of domestic disquiet, or of ruined fortunes; and under the bland and
smiling countenance a heart deceitful and vindictive, and “desperately
wicked,” has often been found concealed.</p>

<hr class='c049' />
<h3 class='c012'>TRADE AND PHILANTHROPY.</h3>

<p class='c023'>In the Memoirs of Bulstrode Whitlocke, the following
anecdote is told as illustrative of the erroneous notions formerly
entertained as to the Employment of Machinery for
purposes of economy. “The advantage of free competition,
and the inexhaustible resources of new inventions, contrivances,
and appliances were,” it is observed by the editor at
that time (1658), “utterly ignored. The Swedish ambassador”
(to the court of Oliver Cromwell) “seems to have
had a gleam of the truth, a dawning consciousness of how
desirable it was to economise human labour by introducing
machinery whenever practicable. He told a pleasant story
of the Czar and a Dutchman; and how the latter, observing
the boats passing upon the Volga to be manned with three
hundred men in each boat, who, in a storm and high wind,
held the bottom of the sails down with their hands, offered
to the former a mode of manning each boat quite as efficiently
with thirty men instead of the three hundred, by
which the cost of transport would be lessened. But the
Emperor called him a knave; and asked him if a boat that
now went with three hundred men should be brought to go
as well with thirty only, how were the other two hundred
and seventy men to get their living?”</p>

<p class='c021'>Cromwell, it will be remembered, protected by Act of
Parliament a sawmill erected in his time, it is imagined, on
the site of the Belvidere-road, Lambeth; in which locality at
this day there is probably more sawing by machinery than
in any other part of England.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>MISCELLANEA.</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Energy</span> and force of character are among the first requisites
essential to success in business. A man may possess
a high degree of refinement, large stores of knowledge, and
even a well-disciplined mind; but if he is destitute of this
one principle, which may be termed resolution of soul, he
is like a watch without a mainspring—beautiful, but inefficient,
and unfit for service.</p>

<p class='c021'>Never do too much at a time, is a good practical maxim.
Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton gives the following history of
his literary habits: Many persons, seeing me so much engaged
in active life, and as much about the world as if I
had never been a student, have said to me, “When do you
get time to write all your books? How on earth do you
contrive to do so much work?” I shall surprise you by the
answer I make. The answer is this: “I contrive to do so
much by never doing too much at a time. A man, to get
through work well, must not overwork himself; or, if he do
too much to-day, the reaction of fatigue will come, and he
will be obliged to do too little to-morrow. Now, since I
began really and earnestly to study, which was not till I
had left college, and was actually in the world, I may perhaps
say I have gone through as large a course of general
reading as most men of my time. I have travelled much,
and I have seen much; I have mixed much in politics, and
the various business of life; and, in addition to all this, I
have published somewhere about sixty volumes, some upon
subjects requiring much research. And what time, do you
think, as a general rule, I have devoted to study—to reading
and writing? Not more than three hours a day; and
when Parliament is sitting, not always that. But then,
during those hours, I have given my whole attention to
what I was about.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Sir Benjamin Brodie says that “humility leads to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>highest distinction, because it leads to self-improvement.”
He adds—and the advice cannot be too often repeated—”study
your own characters; endeavour to learn and supply
your own deficiencies; never assume to yourself qualities
which you do not possess; combine all this with
energy and activity, and you cannot predicate of yourselves,
nor can others predicate of you, at what point you may
arrive at last.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Among the empiric arts of gaining notoriety, that by
engraved portraits has led to some curious results. When
the late John Harrison Curtis, the aurist, came to town to
seek his fortune, he had his portrait engraved in large
handsome style, and offered the same to a printseller to
publish. He demurred, as the original was unknown; but
recommended Curtis to leave his prints at the different
printshops “on sale, or return.” The sudden appearance in
the shop-windows of a large portrait of the great unknown
led to the question, “Who is <i>this</i> Mr. Curtis?” The repeated
inquiries laid the foundation of his fortune, and led
to his living in good style for many years in Soho-square,
and numbering royalty and nobility among his patients;
but he outlived his professional reputation, and died in
reduced circumstances.</p>

<p class='c021'>Silence, says Boyle, discovers Wisdom and conceals Ignorance;
and ’tis a property that is so much belonging to
Wise Men, that even a Fool, when he holdeth his peace,
may pass for one of that sort.</p>

<p class='c021'>It is one thing to see that a line is crooked, and another
thing to be able to draw a straight one. It is not quite so
easy to do a good thing as those imagine who never try.</p>

<p class='c021'>One of Sir Thomas Wyat’s common sayings was, that
there were three things which should always be strictly observed:
“Never to play with any man’s unhappiness or
deformity, for that is inhuman; nor on superiors, for that
is saucy and undutiful; nor on holy matters, for that is
irreligious.”</p>

<p class='c021'>A little grain of the romance is no ill ingredient to preserve
and exalt the dignity of human nature, without which
it is apt to degenerate into everything that is sordid, vicious,
and low.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c025'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>One very common error misleads the opinion of mankind,—that,
universally, authority is pleasant, submission
painful. In the general course of human affairs, the very
reverse of this is nearer the truth. Command is anxiety;
obedience, ease.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c025'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Lamartine has well observed: “Travelling is summing
up a long life in a few years; it is one of the strongest exercises
a man can give his heart and his mind. The philosopher,
the politician, the poet, should all have travelled
much. Changing the moral horizon is to change thought.”</p>

<p class='c021'>“Begin at the Beginning” is an excellent maxim. The
laborious pursuit of first principles brings its own reward.
To begin at the beginning in the sciences, as well as in matters
of fact, is the nearest and safest road to the end. Even
sensible men are too commonly satisfied with tracing their
thoughts a little way backwards, and they are, of course,
soon perplexed by a profounder adversary. In this respect,
most people’s minds are too like a child’s garden, where the
flowers are planted without their roots. It may be said of
morals and of literature, as truly as of sculpture and painting,
that, to understand the outside of human nature, we
should be well acquainted with the inside.</p>

<p class='c021'>Such is the Waywardness of Fate, that one man sucks
an orange, and is choked by a pip; another swallows a penknife,
and lives: one runs a thorn into his hand, and no
skill can save him (a fact of recent date); another has a
shaft of a gig passed completely through his body, and recovers:
one is overturned on a smooth common, and breaks
his neck; another is tossed out of a gig over Brighton cliff,
and survives: one walks on a windy day, and meets death
by a brickbat; another is blown up into the air, like Lord
Hatton, in Guernsey Castle, and comes down uninjured.
The escape of this nobleman was indeed a miracle. An explosion
of gunpowder, which killed his mother, wife, some
of his children, and many other persons, and blew up the
whole fabric of the castle, lodged him and his bed on a wall
overhanging a tremendous precipice. Perceiving a mighty
disorder (as he might expect), he was going to step out of
his bed to know what was the matter, which, if he had done,
he would have been irrecoverably lost; but, in the instant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>of this moving, a flash of lightning came and showed him
the precipice, whereupon he lay still till people came and
took him down.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c025'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>There is an almost prophetic meaning in the following
passage from Berkeley’s “Essay towards Preventing the
Ruin of Great Britain,” written soon after the affair of the
South-Sea Scheme: “All projects for growing rich by sudden
extraordinary methods, as they operate violently on the
passions of men, and encourage them to despise the slow
moderate gains that are to be made by an honest industry,
must be ruinous to the public; and even the winners themselves
will at length be involved in the public ruin.”</p>

<p class='c021'>Theodore Hook was one of the most experienced exponents
of the Town Life of his day: in habits, a bachelor,
notwithstanding his industry as a man of letters, he saw
more of the outside world than the majority of idle men.
He has left many of these experiences in his novels, which,
as pictures of life, are valuable.</p>

<p class='c021'>Thus, in <i>Gilbert Gurney</i>, he gives this admirable bit of
club criticism: “People who are conscious of what is due
to themselves never display irritability or impetuosity; their
manners insure civility—their own civility secures respect:
but the blockhead or the coxcomb, fully aware that something
more than ordinary is necessary to produce an effect,
is sure, whether in clubs or coffee-houses, to be the most
fastidious and factious of the community, the most overbearing
in his manners towards his inferiors, the most restless
and irritable among his equals, the most cringing and
subservient before his superiors.” No man could utter such
criticism with more complete safety from being answered
with a <i>Tu quoque</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PREDICTIONS OF SUCCESS.</h3>

<p class='c023'>A few noteworthy incidents have occurred in the early
lives of great men, which have singularly accorded with
their success in after-life.</p>

<p class='c021'>The first notice of Lord Chancellor Somers as a boy is
exceedingly curious. In Cooksey’s <i>Life and Character of
Lord Somers</i>, the following is stated to be well authenticated.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>It is to the effect that the boy was walking with one of his
aunts, under whose care he was placed at the time, when
“a beautiful roost-cock flew upon his curly head, and while
perched there crowed three times very loudly.” The occurrence
was instantly viewed as an omen of his future
greatness.</p>

<p class='c021'>Pope, writing to Lord Orrery, after first witnessing Garrick’s
performance of Richard III., said, “That young man
never had his equal as an actor, and will never have a rival.”
As yet the prophecy is unshaken.</p>

<p class='c021'>A few weeks before Lord Chatham died, Lord Camden
paid him a visit. Chatham’s son, William Pitt, left the room
on Lord Camden’s coming in. “You see that young man,”
said the old lord; “what I now say, be assured, is not the
fond partiality of a parent, but grounded on a very accurate
examination. Rely upon it, that young man will be more
distinguished in this country than ever his father was.” His
prophecy was in part accomplished. At the age of twenty-four
he was Chancellor of the Exchequer; and before he
had attained his twenty-fifth year, had been offered, and
refused, the place of First Minister.</p>

<p class='c021'>When Horatio Nelson was a weakly child, he gave proofs
of that resolute heart and nobleness of mind which, during
his whole career of labour and of glory, so eminently distinguished
him. When a mere boy, he strayed a bird’s-nesting
from his grandmother’s house, in company with a
cow-boy; the dinner-hour elapsed, he was absent, and could
not be found; the alarm of the family then became very
great, for they apprehended that he might have been carried
off by gipsies. At length, after search had been made for
him in various directions, he was discovered alone, sitting
composedly by the side of a brook which he could not get
over. “I wonder, child,” said the old lady when she saw
him, “that hunger and fear did not drive you home.”
“Fear! grandmamma,” replied the future hero; “I never
saw fear—what is it?”</p>

<p class='c021'>Arthur Wellesley, when at school at Chelsea, was a boy
of indolent and careless manner, and rather than join in the
amusements of the playground delighted to lean against a
large tree, observing his schoolfellows when playing around
him. If any boy played unfairly, Arthur quickly apprised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>those engaged in the game: on the delinquent being turned
out, it was generally wished that he should supply his place;
but nothing could induce him to do so: when beset by a
party of five or six, he would fight with the utmost courage
and determination until he freed himself from their grasp;
he would then retire again to his tree, and look about him,
as observant as before. Such was the love of fair play in
the boy who became the great Duke of Wellington.</p>

<p class='c021'>An incident in the life of Parry, the intrepid Arctic navigator,
may also be related here. He left Bath, accompanied
by an old and faithful servant of the family, with whom he
travelled to Plymouth, and who did not leave him till he
saw him finally settled in the <i>Ville de Paris</i> man-of-war. To
Parry all was new. He had never before beheld the sea,
and his experience of naval matters had been confined to
the small craft on the river Avon. He seemed almost struck
dumb with astonishment at his first sight of the ocean and
of a line-of-battle ship; but, after a while recovering himself,
he began eagerly to examine every thing around him, and
to ask numberless questions of all who were inclined to
listen. While so engaged, he saw one of the sailors descending
the rigging from aloft; and in a moment, before the
astonished servant knew what Parry was about, he sprang
forward, and, with his wonted agility, clambered up to the
mast-head, from which giddy elevation he waved his cap in
triumph to those whom he had left below. When he regained
the deck, the sailors, who had witnessed the feat,
gathered round him and commended his spirit, telling him
he was “a fine fellow, and a true sailor every inch of him.”
We can well imagine with what gratification the various
members of his family would receive the account of this and
every other incident connected with his first entry on his
new career, and how eagerly they would hail his conduct on
this occasion as a happy omen of future success.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c025'><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c012'>EASE OF MIND.</h3>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>In</span> order to enjoy Ease of Mind in our intercourse with
the world, we should introduce into our habits of business
punctuality, decision, the practice of being beforehand, despatch,
and exactness; in our pleasures, harmlessness and
moderation; and in all our dealings, perfect integrity and
love of truth. Without these observances we are never secure
of ease, nor indeed taste it in its highest state. As in
most other things, so here, people in general do not aim at
more than mediocrity of attainment, and of course usually
fall below their standard; whilst many are so busy in running
after what should procure them ease, that they totally
overlook the thing itself.</p>

<p class='c021'>Ease of mind has the most beneficial effect upon the
body, and it is only during its existence that the complicated
physical functions are performed with the accuracy
and facility which nature designed. It is, consequently, a
great preventive of disease, and one of the secret means of
effecting a cure when disease has occurred; without it, in
many cases, no cure can take place. By ease of mind many
people have survived serious accidents, from which nothing
else could have saved them, and in every instance is much
retarded by the absence of it. Its effect upon the appearance
is no less remarkable. It prevents and repairs the
ravages of time in a singular degree, and is the best preservative
of strength and beauty. It often depends greatly
upon health, but health always depends greatly upon it.
The torments of a mind ill at ease seem to be less endurable
than those of the body; for it scarcely ever happens
that suicide is committed from bodily suffering. As far as
the countenance is an index, “the vultures of the mind”
appear to turn it more mercilessly than any physical pain;
and no doubt there have been many who would willingly
have exchanged their mental agony for the most wretched
existence that penury could produce. From remorse there
is no escape. In aggravated cases probably there is no instant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>sleeping or waking, in which its influence is totally
unfelt. Remorse is the extreme one way; the opposite is
that cleanliness of mind which has never been recommended
any where to the same extent that it is by the precepts of
the Christian religion, and which alone constitutes “perfect
freedom.” It would be curious if we could see what effect
such purity would have upon the appearance and actions of
a human being—a being who lived, as Pope expresses it, in
the “eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.” Goldsmith
has beautifully said:</p>

<p class='c021'>Charles James Fox, who was, from infancy, a spoiled
child, would spend night after night in gambling, and wasting
his sweet nature in the orgies of Bacchus. Then he
would flee away to the delightful scenery and refreshing air
of St. Anne’s Hill, and there betake himself to gardening, in
a blue apron; or to the learned leisure of his study, in the
bosom of conjugal felicity and friendship.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE LIFE OF MAN.</h3>

<p class='c023'>It is impossible to say what analogy exists between the
race and the individual, and attempts to explain the history
of the one by the stages which mark the life of the other
are at best more ingenious than satisfactory; but almost
every fact with which we are acquainted seems to suggest
that some such analogy exists, though its particulars are altogether
unknown, and though we cannot even say whether
mankind ought to be compared to one individual or to
several. It may, however, be allowable, in dealing with a
subject which, after all, appeals rather to the feelings and
to the imagination than to the reason, to point out the fact
that the cessation of human society would present a striking
analogy to the death of individuals; and that there would be
the same contradictory mixture of completeness and incompleteness
about a society eternally renewed, as there would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>be about a human being who never died. That the life of a
man forms a moral whole, is a conviction which is so thoroughly
worked into our minds and our very language, that
no one doubts it. That it is a mysterious and utterly contradictory
thing at its best estate, is the experience of every
person who has even ordinary powers of reflection. It is
hard to imagine the degree in which these mysteries and
contradictions would be heightened if man were immortal.
If, after arriving at that average degree of prudence and self-restraint
which almost every one attains comparatively early
in life, people lived on and on for centuries and millenniums,
carrying on the same sort of transactions, settling
the same difficulties, enjoying the same pleasures, and suffering
from the same vexations, the question why they ever
were sent into the world at all (which is even now sufficiently
perplexing) would become altogether overwhelming;
and the faith which people at present maintain in the Divine
government of the world would have to be based on entirely
different grounds, if it survived at all. It is perhaps not
merely fanciful to suggest that a somewhat similar difficulty
would exist if human society, after a long and laborious
education, were to attain to a stationary state, and were then
to go on indefinitely enjoying itself. Such a heaven on earth
would be at best a sort of high life below stairs.</p>

<p class='c021'>The celebration of the triumphs of civilisation, which is
at present in full bloom, produces on many minds an effect
not unlike that which Robespierre’s feasts to the Supreme
Being produced on his colleagues. “You and your nineteenth
century are beginning to be a bore,” is the salutation
which many a philosopher would receive in these days from
a sincere audience. Weigh and measure and classify as we
will, we are but poor creatures, when all is said and done.
It would be a relief to think that a day was coming when
the world, whether more comfortable or not, would at least
see and know itself as it is, and when the real gist and bearing
of all the work, good and evil, that is done under the
sun, should at last be made plain. Till then, knowledge,
science, and power are, after all, little more than shadows
in a troubled dream—a dream which will soon pass away
from each of us, if it does not pass away at once from all.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c025'><sup>[132]</sup></a></p>

  <h3 class='c012'>THE GOOD MAN’s LIFE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Some are called <i>at age</i> at fourteen, some at one-and-twenty,
some never; but all men late enough, for the life of a man
comes upon him slowly and insensibly. But as when the
sun approaching towards the gates of the morning, he first
opens a little the eye of heaven, and sends away the spirits
of darkness, and gives light to a cock, and calls up the lark
to matins, and by and by gilds the fringes of a cloud, and
peeps over the eastern hills, thrusting out his golden horns,
like those which decked the brows of Moses when he was
forced to wear a veil, because himself had seen the face of
God; and still while a man tells the story, the sun gets up
higher, till he shows a fair face and a full light, and then he
shines one whole day, under a cloud often, and sometimes
weeping great and little showers, and sets quickly: so is
man’s reason and his life. He first begins to perceive himself
to see or taste, making little reflections upon his actions
of sense, and can discourse of flies and dogs, shells and play,
horses and liberty; but when he is strong enough to enter
into arts and little institutions, he is at first entertained with
trifles and impertinent things, not because he needs them,
but because his understanding is no bigger, and little images
of things are laid before him, like a cockboat to a whale,
only to play withal: but before a man comes to be wise, he
is half-dead with gouts and consumption, with catarrhs and
aches, with sore eyes and a worn-out body. So that if we
must not reckon the life of a man but by the amounts of his
reason, he is long before his soul be dressed; and he is not
to be called a man without a wise and an adorned soul, a
soul at least furnished with what is necessary towards his
well-being: but by that time his soul is thus furnished, his
body is decayed; and then you can hardly reckon him to
be alive, when his body is possessed by so many degrees of
death.</p>

<hr class='c046' />

<p class='c021'>But if I shall describe a living man, a man that hath
that life which distinguishes him from a fool or a bird, that
which gives him a capacity next to angels, we shall find
that even a good man lives not long; because it is long before
he is born to this life, and longer yet before he hath a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>man’s growth. “He that can look upon death, and see its
face with the same countenance with which he hears its
story; he that can endure all the labours of his life with
his soul supporting his body; that can equally despise
riches when he hath them, and when he hath them not;
that is not sadder if they lie in his neighbour’s trunks, nor
more brag if they shine round about his own walls; he that
is neither moved with good fortune coming to him, nor
going from him; that can look upon another man’s lands
evenly and pleasantly as if they were his own, and yet look
upon his own, and use them too, just as if they were another
man’s; that neither spends his goods prodigally and
like a fool, nor yet keeps them avariciously and like a wretch;
that weighs not benefits by weight and number, but by the
mind and circumstances of him that gives them; that never
thinks his charity expensive if a worthy person be the receiver;
he that does nothing for opinion sake, but every
thing for conscience, being as curious of his thoughts as of
his actings in markets and theatres, and is as much in awe
of himself as of a whole assembly; he that knows God looks
on, and contrives his secret affairs as if in the presence of
God and his holy angels; that eats and drinks because he
needs it, not that he may serve a lust or load his belly; he
that is bountiful and cheerful to his friends, and charitable
and apt to forgive his enemies; that loves his country, and
obeys his prince, and desires and endeavours nothing more
than that they may do honour to God:”<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c025'><sup>[133]</sup></a> this person may
reckon his life to be the life of a man, and compute his
months not by the course of the sun, but the zodiac and
circle of his virtues; because these are such things which
fools and children and birds and beasts cannot have; these
are therefore the actions of life, because they are the seeds
of immortality. That day in which we have done some excellent
thing, we may as truly reckon to be added to our life,
as were the fifteen years to the days of Hezekiah.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c025'><sup>[134]</sup></a></p>

  <h3 class='c012'>PREDICTIONS OF FLOWERS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c023'>To what excellent account have our thoughtful old writers
turned these prophetic indications of changeful flowers!
Bishop Hall, in his <i>Occasional Meditations</i>, has the following
“On the Light of Tulips, and Marigolds, &amp;c. in his
Garden:” “These flowers are the true clients of the sun;
how observant they are of his motion and influence! At
even, they shut up, as mourning for his departure, without
whom they neither can see nor flourish; in the morning,
they welcome his rising with a cheerful openness; and at
noon, are fully displayed in a free acknowledgment of his
bounty.</p>

<p class='c021'>“Thus doth the good heart turn unto God. ‘<i>When thou
turnedst away thy face, I was troubled</i>,’ saith the man after
God’s own heart. ‘<i>In thy presence is life; yea, the fulness of
joy.</i>’ Thus doth the carnal heart to the world: when that
withdraws its favours, he is dejected; and revives with a
smile. All is in our choice. Whatsoever is our sun will
thus carry us.</p>

<p class='c021'>“O God, be Thou to me such as Thou art in Thyself:
Thou shalt be merciful in drawing me; I shall be happy in
following thee.”</p>

<p class='c021'>The use of Perfumes in the last century exceeded that
in the present day. Possibly the old notion that they were
employed to mask the exhalations from diseased persons
may have driven perfumes out of fashion in our day; we
recollect <i>musk</i> to have been specially so considered. Bishop
Hall, in his <i>Occasional Meditations</i>, adverts to this use of
perfumes in a meditation illustrative of a custom which is
associated with the symbolic character of “flowers and redolent
plants, just emblems of the life of man, which has
been compared in Holy Scriptures to those fading beauties,
whose roots, being buried in dishonour, rise again in
glory.”<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c025'><sup>[135]</sup></a> The Bishop’s meditation is “On the Sight of a
Coffin stuck with Flowers:”</p>

<p class='c021'>“Too fair in appearance is never free from just suspicion.
While there was nothing but wood, no flower was to
be seen here; now that this wood is lined with an unsavoury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>corpse, it is adorned with this sweet variety. The
fir, whereof that coffin is made, yields a natural redolence
alone; now that it is stuffed thus noisomely, all helps are
too little to countervail that scent of corruption.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c025'><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c028'>Professor Faraday, at the close of a Lecture on Gas Glass-house Furnaces,
delivered at the Royal Institution in 1862, alluded, in an affecting
manner, to his increasing loss of memory. There was a time, he
observed, when he inclined to think that Memory was a faculty of
secondary order; but he now feels its great importance; and the deficiency
of that power, he said, would prevent him from again bringing
before them any thing that was new; for he was often unable to recollect
even his own precious researches, and he could no longer trust
himself to lecture without notes.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><i>Great Ages</i> (<i>page</i> <a href='#Page_114'>114</a>).</h3>

<p class='c028'>An old woman who died in 1858 in St. Patrick-street, Dublin, at the
age of 110 years, distinctly remembered and described the appearance
of Dean Swift, and added, that he never went outside the Deanery-house
that he was not attended through the streets by a vast crowd of washed
and unwashed admirers.</p>

<p class='c041'>Mrs. Keith, of Newnham, Gloucestershire, who died in 1772, aged
133, left three daughters, aged 111, 110, and 100.</p>

<p class='c041'>In 1862, a lady residing at Cheltenham received a second donation
of 5<i>l.</i> from her Majesty the Queen, for an old man of 107 years of age,
named William Purser, a native of Redmarley, but living in Cheltenham.—<i>Worcestershire
Chronicle.</i></p>

<p class='c041'>In 1862, a curious fact occurred at Downton, showing how few individuals
are required to connect distant periods of history with the
present time. A man was buried in this parish whose father was born
in the reign of William III., and that father lived in three centuries,
having been born in 1698 and died in 1801.—<i>Salisbury Journal.</i></p>

<p class='c041'>In 1853, the Irish newspapers announced the death of Mrs. Mary
Power, aunt of the celebrated Mr. Shiel, at the Ursuline Convent, Cork,
at the age of 116 years; but this statement lacks legal evidence to
prove it.</p>

<p class='c041'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>The obituary of the <i>Times</i> of January 21, 1863, records the decease
of persons who had attained the following advanced ages, viz.: 92, 90,
82, 82, 82, 80, 78, 78, 76, 74, 72, 72, 72, and 70 years respectively.</p>

<p class='c041'>Dr. Mead, grandfather of the celebrated physician and antiquary,
died at Ware, in Hertfordshire, 1652, aged 148.</p>

<p class='c041'>In Scawen’s <i>Dissertation on the Cornish Tongue</i>, written in the reign
of Charles II., is mentioned a woman recently deceased, who was "164
years old, of good memory, and healthful at her age; living in the
parish of Gwithian. She married a second husband after she was 80,
and buried him after he was 80 years of age."</p>

<p class='c041'>A Philadelphia Correspondent of <i>Notes and Queries</i>, No. 213, 1853,
records the death of "Aunt Polly" (Mary Simondson), near Shippensburg,
Pennsylvania, at the age of 126 years.</p>

<p class='c041'>Among the legacies bequeathed to the Middlesex Hospital in 1863,
was one which is deserving of special notice, inasmuch as the donor,
Mr. Cropper, exhibited a singular instance of rigid economy in his personal
expenditure, combined with a bountiful and almost princely benevolence
towards the poor. Mr. Cropper, who was 90 years old when
he died, had, it appears, survived all his relations. He was a barrister-at-law,
and lived in the most frugal manner in his chambers at Gray’s-inn.
The amount of his property at the time of his decease is estimated
at about 4000<i>l.</i> per annum, and 10,000<i>l.</i> in money, the whole of
which he has bestowed on London charities, selecting Middlesex Hospital
as his residuary legatee.</p>

<p class='c041'>In the <i>Express</i> of February 11, 1863, it is recorded: Two octogenarians,
named Joseph and John Fitzwalter, brothers, lived together
with their sister in a house in Parliament street for a great number
of years. The brothers had been brought up to the business of lace-designing,
and the sister had acted in the capacity of housekeeper.
Joseph, the elder one, was a short time ago attacked with bronchitis,
under which he lingered for some time in much pain. On Wednesday
last (February 4), however, he died, at the ripe old age of 84 years.
The brother and sister of the deceased were much affected by his death,
the brother showing excessive signs of grief. His grieving, however,
was not long, for he expired in one hour after his brother. The death
of two brothers, to whom she was devoutly attached, was a shock which
the sister was unable to withstand; and on the morning fixed for their
interment she also expired, at the age of 88 years.</p>

<hr class='c049' />
<h3 class='c012'><i>Baron Maseres</i> <a href='#bm'>(<i>page</i> 149)</a>.</h3>
<p class='c028'>Baron Maseres long resided at Reigate, in a fine old brick mansion,
about midway between the church and town. His remains rest in a
vault in the churchyard towards the north-east; upon the tomb over
which Dr. Fellowes has inscribed an epitaph in elegant Latinity, terminating
thus: "Vale, vir optime! amice, vale, carissime; et siqua
rerum humanarum tibi sit adhuc conscientia, monimentum, quod in tui
memoriam, tui etiam in mortuis observantissimus Robertus Fellowes
ponendum curavit, solitâ benevolentiâ tuearis."</p>

<p class='c041'>On Sundays the Baron, bent with age, might be seen advancing up
the nave of Reigate church; for he was a sound churchman, and testified
his sincerity by making an Endowment for an Afternoon Sermon to be
preached on Sundays, with this proviso, that, in case of non-observance
of the bequest, the endowment should be given in bread to the poor.
The chancels, with their faded pomp of effigied monuments, hatchments,
and armorial glass, have little attraction compared with this
interesting memorial of practical piety.</p>

    <div>CRITICAL OPINIONS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>"This volume is likely to meet with as good a reception as any of its predecessors,
for no one can open it without finding something in it that is at once amusing and
instructive. All the information which it contains is modestly and pleasantly given....
It will be seen that this volume abounds with diverting and suggestive extracts. It
seems to us particularly well adapted for parochial lending-libraries."—<i>Saturday Review.</i></p>

<p class='c021'>"Full of odd, quaint, out-of-the-way bits of information upon all imaginable subjects
is this amusing volume, wherein Mr. Timbs discourses upon domestic, rural, metropolitan,
and social life; interesting nooks of English localities; time-honoured customs,
and old-world observances; and, we need hardly add, Mr. Timbs discourses well and
pleasantly upon all."—<i>Notes and Queries.</i></p>

<p class='c021'>"This is another of those curious repertories of out-of-the-way facts, to the compilation
of which Mr. Timbs appears to have a prescriptive right. The reader must be at
once very well-informed and very difficult to please who fails to find in <i>Something for
Everybody</i> ample materials both for instruction and amusement."—<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p class='c021'>"A collection made by a diligent scholar in a long life of literature, and imparting
information in such a manner as to be pleasing to the young and welcome to the old.
Mr. Timbs has published many good books, but none better or more deserving of popularity
than that to which he has given the appropriate title of <i>Something for Everybody</i>."—<i>London
Review.</i></p>

<p class='c021'>"In this volume the author certainly maintains the position which he has won for
himself as a most indefatigable collector and compiler of useful information, in a form
at once clear, accurate, and vastly entertaining."—<i>English Churchman.</i></p>

<p class='c021'>"A very entertaining volume, full of varied information."—<i>Builder.</i></p>

<p class='c021'>"It is a great deal to be able to say in favour of this book that we have discovered
nothing in it which can annoy or offend a member of any Christian denomination; and
that many of the quotations are not only valuable in themselves, but have been collected
from sources not easily accessible to the general reader. Not a few of the chapters are,
however, Mr. Welby’s own composition; and these are, for the most part, thoughtfully
and carefully written."—<i>The Critic.</i></p>

<p class='c021'>"The author and compiler of this work is evidently a largely-read and deeply-thinking
man. For its plentiful suggestiveness alone it should meet with a kindly and grateful
acceptance. It is a pleasant, dreamy, charming, startling little volume, every page of
which sparkles like a gem in an antique setting."—<i>Weekly Dispatch.</i></p>

<p class='c021'>"This book is the result of extensive reading and careful noting; it is such a commonplace
book as some thoughtful divine or physician might have compiled, gathering
together a vast variety of opinions and speculations bearing on physiology, the phenomena
of life, and the nature and future existence of the soul. With these are blended
facts, anecdotes, personal traits of character, and well-grounded arguments, with the
one guiding intention of strengthening the Christian’s faith with the thoughts and conclusions
of the great and good of the earth. Mr. Horace Welby has brought together a
mass of matter that might be sought in vain through the most extensive library; and we
know of no work that so strongly compels reflection, and so well assists it."—<i>Lond. Review.</i></p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
